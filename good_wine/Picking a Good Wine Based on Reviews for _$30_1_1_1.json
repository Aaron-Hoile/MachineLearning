Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.\tAmour de Dieu\t90\t90\tRh??ne Valley\tCondrieu\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu)\tViognier\tJean-Luc Colombo\n3194\tUS\tThis wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core.

The palate is fairly rich and layered, but it's also properly acidic and, therefore, well balanced. The flavors of pear and butter seem on the money, and the finish is solid and of moderate length. All in all, this is a very good Chardonnay with no overt faults.\tEstate Bottled - Prima Reserva\t89\t10\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDe Martino 2000 Estate Bottled - Prima Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)\tChardonnay\tDe Martino\n69032\tItaly\tA hugely spicy wine, with ripe, full-bodied fruit and a touch of toast.

The wine, a multiappellation blend, really pops in the mouth. The fruit is ripe and the power is there. However, for someone looking for a reserved red made in the Bordeaux style, something that Chile can deliver, this could come across as aggressive, as the acidity is a bit sharp.\tBravura\t89\t50\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCalina 1999 Bravura Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCalina\n69039\tUS\tWhat a great wine this is.

Hofstatter\n69043\tUS\tThe darkest and richest of this winery's trio of Pinots, a big-boned wine with surface flavors ranging from blackberries and cherries to cola, leather and tobacco. There's a meatiness to the texture that makes it a perfect match for food.

Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish.

The simple light-bodied palate offers sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of orange peel. It's on the slender side, with firm acidity and loose-knit tannins.\t\t86\t23\tTuscany\tRosso di Montalcino\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tVal di Suga 2014  Rosso di Montalcino\tSangiovese\tVal di Suga\n52693\tArgentina\tGrassy and herbal berry aromas suggest beet root.

Fresh and bright green aromas outdo the more savory ones, conveying Anjou pear, jasmine and light apple cider on the nose. Green apple and more pear show on the palate, with a pithy apple-skin flavor providing tang to the slight acidity.\tUnoaked\t86\t22\tCalifornia\tMonterey\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCarmel Road 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Monterey)\tChardonnay\tCarmel Road\n52698\tFrance\tThis is a soft, gently fruity wine.

Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.\tBien Nacido Vineyards\t92\t42\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tStephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\tPinot Noir\tStephen Ross\n52942\tUS\tThis is a big, bold and dry wine that will pair well with roast lamb chops or grilled steaks. Spice rack aromas and generous blackberry, boysenberry and black-cherry flavors ride a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins.

Blackberries rule here, but there is a strong menthol/mint streak as well, which leaves the palate feeling as if a curiously strong breath mint has recently passed through. Kason seems to have great fruit sources, packaged in a rather rustic style, but offering quite delicious and bold flavors at moder prices.\tOld Vine Reserve\t88\t29\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tKason 2006 Old Vine Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tKason\n52945\tSpain\tFor an off vintage, this is a nice wine. It has a touch of leafiness on the nose but also dark fruit, shoe polish and style. Gets better as it airs out, and thus the raspberry and plum flavors take on a forward, easygoing likability. Textured on the finish, and definitely not dilute or choppy like so many others from 2002.\tReserva\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuis Ca?ñas 2002 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tLuis Ca?ñas\n52946\tSpain\tDark in color, with licorice, kirsch, mineral and prune aromas. This registers as a ripe wine with a soft frame. It's not flabby but it does seem a bit oily and rich, with black cherry and baked plum flavors. Finishes a touch short, but also a little thick. Drink now through 2010.\tFinca El Puig\t88\t38\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFuentes 2004 Finca El Puig Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFuentes\n52947\tItaly\tThis base Barolo offers upfront aromas of tealeaf, moist tobacco, apple skin, cedar wood, white cherry and wild berry. Those notes are overlapped and tangled yet the wine finds balance in the mouth thanks to the supporting role of tannins and acidity. Overall, this is a fresh, traditional and direct expression of Nebbiolo.\t\t88\t60\tPiedmont\tBarolo\t\t\t\tGiribaldi 2004  Barolo\tNebbiolo\tGiribaldi\n52948\tUS\tShows wonderfully ripe, pure Pinot Noir fruit flavors, with black and red cherries and currants elaborated with exotic Asian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood.

It's fairly tannic but well-structured, with subtle flavors of dried cherries, red currants, pepper and violets. Drink now.\t\t88\t30\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tMadrigal 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tMadrigal\n52953\tUS\tLots of richness in this smoky young Merlot. You'll find detailed flavors of grilled blackberries, red and black cherry preserves, leather, anise and cedar.

Don't be one of them. As delicious as it is now in blackberries and chocolate, it will be better in 2015 or 2016.

Right off the bat, it's austere, but when it airs, the tropical fruit, orange and oak complexities come out. The parts have not yet come together, though, so give it 3ƒ??4 years to develop.\tHyde Vineyard\t90\t58\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tPatz & Hall 2010 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tPatz & Hall\n52187\tFrance\tThis is a wood-aged Chardonnay that's smooth, creamy and rich. The wine has weight, with lemon and peach flavors as well as vanilla accents from the oak. Its current fruitiness will mature and broaden well, so keep this wine for at least four years.\tCuv??e Madeleine\t90\t22\tSouthwest France\tC??tes du Tarn\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine D'en S??gur 2011 Cuv??e Madeleine Chardonnay (C??tes du Tarn)\tChardonnay\tDomaine D'en S??gur\n52188\tChile\tFoxy blueberry and jumpy aromas hint at volatility and are a bit alarming. But give this normally excellent wine some time and it comes around. In the mouth, this is textured, tannic and a bit lactic. For flavors, look for lightly herbal blueberry and cassis. The 2010 vintage was cold by Chilean standards, and that is evident in this wine.\tG?¦\t90\t92\tColchagua Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmiliana 2010 G?¦ Red (Colchagua Valley)\tRed Blend\tEmiliana\n52189\tChile\tDense cassis and berry aromas aren't nuanced or complex but they sure are correct and ripe.

In the mouth, it's extraordinarily rich in blackberry jam and cassis, with the chocolaty, roasted meat notes that frequently characterize a good Syrah. Although it's pretty tannic, it's appealing now, and should develop for 4ƒ??5 more years.\t\t90\t28\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\t\t\tFess Parker 2011 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)\tSyrah\tFess Parker\n52191\tUS\tA soft, pleasant Chardonnay that has some extra features beyond the ripe, oaky fruit flavors.

Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\t\tFoley 2010 T Anchor Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)\tChardonnay\tFoley\n52192\tUS\tThis is the kind of wine Franciscan produces so well and reliably. As far as Merlots go, it shows the soft approachability and supple tannins you expect. Flavorwise, it's appealing in ripe red cherries, sweet red licorice and smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine, and easy to find, with more than 20,000 cases produced.\t\t90\t21\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tFranciscan 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tFranciscan\n52193\tUS\tGood price for a Chardonnay this opulent.

Roughly half spent time in new French oak, which brings a lovely toasty note into the foreground. There's a slight, not unpleasant funkiness, along with dusty baking spices, black cherry and currant, and a chunk of dark chocolate. It's big, bold and delicious, and drinking quite well at the moment.\tArsenal\t92\t40\tOregon\tApplegate Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tQuady North 2012 Arsenal Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Applegate Valley)\tCabernet Franc-Merlot\tQuady North\n126028\tUS\tFresh-pressed strawberry, sugar beet, lavender and rose petal aromas show in this botting, which is a complex take on Tempranillo.

Beyond that is dark fruit, black cherry and cr??me de cassis. Shadings of lead pencil, leather and tobacco fill in the rear. This Brunello presents a soft, round mouthfeel with cherry flavors capped by tight structure.\t\t94\t79\tTuscany\tBrunello di Montalcino\t\t\t\tPoggio Antico 2007  Brunello di Montalcino\tSangiovese Grosso\tPoggio Antico\n49326\tHungary\tSurprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.\tEssencia\t94\t764\tTokaji\t\t\tAnna Lee C.

A Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's so rich and opulent, it just dazzles from start to finish. Floods the mouth with sweet cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate and red licorice, yet gets structure from firm tannins and bracing acidity.

Attractive honey, melon and buttered-toast aromas dance on the nose, and the creamy yet structured palate offers coconut and banana flavors along with proper acids. It's very much like the inaugural '99 wine, maybe a bit better balanced, but less concentrated. Regardless, it's still potent Chardonnay featuring plenty of high-grade oak.\t\t89\t32\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuca 2000 Chardonnay (Mendoza)\tChardonnay\tLuca\n49581\tUS\tOn the nose, lively peach and tropical fruit aromas are kept in check by a cottony-chalky note. Not at all cloying, this Moscato is well balanced, with plenty of mango flavors. Finishes with garden-sweet honeysuckle and sunflower notes. Though Beaulac recommends it with spicy food (especially Thai), we think it'd be just as nice to sip on the beach.\tSweet White\t89\t15\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tSt. Sup??ry 2001 Sweet White Moscato (California)\tMoscato\tSt. Sup??ry\n49582\tAustralia\tThere's nothing subtle about this wine, which layers tropical fruit and pecan aromas over flavors of buttered nuts and citrus.

This one is, with its black-cherry, spice and tobacco aromas and flavors and dry, lacy tannins.

But without any preconceptions, this wine was still delicious. The promising oaky aromas of honey drizzled over toast, coconut and vanilla are backed by white peach. It's tightly wound and less giving on the palate.\tTiers Vineyard\t89\t120\tSouth Australia\tPiccadilly Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPetaluma 1999 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (Piccadilly Valley)\tChardonnay\tPetaluma\n49587\tUS\tFrom this Rh??ne specialist, a nice sipping wine with powerfully fruity flavors in a delicately structured, light-bodied wine.

But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years.\tDate Night\t93\t75\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tPhifer Pavitt 2007 Date Night Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPhifer Pavitt\n52794\tItaly\tMade by celebrated winemaker Vittorio Fiore, this gorgeous Sangiovese-based wine shows the lavish intensity and creamy consistency of Tuscany's world famous reds.

It's youthful with aromas of toasty barrel spices, dark roasted coffee and high-toned savory herbs. Flavors are light and restrained while still showing a lot of richness, with the dark fruit notes backed by mouthwatering acids. Just a baby now, this is a 20-year wine that should start to strut its stuff after 2024.

It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end. Look for more of this varietal from Darioush as its Shiraz vineyards mature.\t\t92\t64\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tDarioush 2000 Shiraz (Napa Valley)\tShiraz\tDarioush\tGT_90_Points\n64626\tUS\tA dry-smelling wine, with hints of cinnamon, pine bark, eucalyptus and earth, that unfold slowly on the palate to reveal bright red cherries and berries. It's big and it's structured, yet finishes smooth and silky, blending in coffee and tea notes.

It has weight, and is packed with ripe peach and peppered pineapple flavors. It is obviously capable of aging for at least three years.

However, the palate is rounded and generous, with layers of red apple, Comice pear, honeydew melon and orange zest. The finish is whistle clean and that counterpoint of breezy freshness and rounded ripeness makes you want to sip more.\tSpitzer 1000-Eimerberg Smaragd\t92\t30\tWachau\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\t@AnneInVino\tLagler 2013 Spitzer 1000-Eimerberg Smaragd Neuburger (Wachau)\tNeuburger\tLagler\tGT_90_Points\n57163\tUS\tDe Loach continues to impress with this Lake County vineyard-designate, a well-balanced Zin with plenty of density amid its brick tar and brambly blackberry fruit.

This was one of my favorites, teeming with pepper-tinged blueberries and accented by hints of roasted meat and espresso. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish.\tThe Other Side Single Vineyard\t91\t85\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2011 The Other Side Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\n122496\tUS\tAnother knockout of this vintage from this site, a portion within the larger estate Quail Hill Vineyard, Summit is perfumed and pretty, full bodied without ever seeming heavy.

Fresh and precise, it's tinged with slightly bitter herbs. The cranberry and raspberry fruits set up with ample acidity. There's excellent definition and pull through on the flavors, with a lick of milk chocolate from limited time in once-used barrels.\tDijon 115\t91\t60\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tHyland 2014 Dijon 115 Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\tPinot Noir\tHyland\tGT_90_Points\n7374\tAustria\tThis has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy.

Pomegranate, black cherry and tea combine to delicious effect, giving the wine enough body and soul to remain memorable through the long, tea-stained finish.\tDutton Ranch\t94\t40\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tDutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDutton-Goldfield\tGT_90_Points\n103192\tUS\tNot yet fully open, this blend of Les Collines and Seven Hills vineyard fruit has high-toned aromas of violets, sage, toffee and black plums. The feel is supple, showing depth and detail to the dark fruit flavors along with exceptional length. It's all about subtlety and elegance.\tPrincipia Reserve\t93\t85\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tRasa 2012 Principia Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tRasa\tGT_90_Points\n103197\tItaly\tFragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of wild berry, menthol, leather, tilled soil and aromatic herbs. The palate doles out wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and anise. Bracing tannins and racy acidity give it an ageworthy structure, but don't attempt this until after 2020.\tSarmassa\t93\t67\tPiedmont\tBarolo\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tBrezza 2011 Sarmassa  (Barolo)\tNebbiolo\tBrezza\tGT_90_Points\n42167\tUS\tAnother successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time. Interesting as an alternative to a big Zinfandel or Petite Sirah.\t\t91\t28\tCalifornia\tMonterey\tCentral Coast\t\t\tCambiata 2007 Tannat (Monterey)\tTannat\tCambiata\tGT_90_Points\n44161\tUS\tThis is a serious red wine, powerful and authoritative in Petite Sirah character, but be forewarned, it's pretty tannic, and nowhere near ready. That probably won't stop most folks from popping the cork now, and they'll like the blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors just fine withgrilled steaks and chops. But the wine will develop fascinating bottle complexities for many years.\t\t92\t40\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tMiner 2005 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tMiner\tGT_90_Points\n54687\tUS\tComing from Red Mountain's most esteemed vineyard, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coffee bean and dark cherry.

It shows the same dense mountain tannins and dryness, but is comprised of red cherry, red currant and violet flavors, in addition to the sweet smoky oak. Best now, with decanting, and through 2011.\tMarcellini Vineyard\t90\t75\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\t\t\tVon Strasser 2006 Marcellini Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Franc\tVon Strasser\tGT_90_Points\n52675\tUS\tThis is from a fantastic vineyard site in the Laguna Hills neighborhood of the appellation, and the second vintage of this particular selection from this producer.

With ample depth and elegance, this takes time to open up but provides a lovely, velvety texture, with ripe but still textured tannins. This is ready now but will also benefit from cellaring.\tRabenkropf\t90\t40\tBurgenland\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\t@AnneInVino\tWohlmuth 2011 Rabenkropf Blaufr??nkisch (Burgenland)\tBlaufr??nkisch\tWohlmuth\tGT_90_Points\n15008\tUS\tA wonderful bouquet, like that of a well-aged wine, helps this spicy, fruity bottling stand out.

Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish.\tFortieth Anniversary Vintage\t91\t28\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCalera 2015 Fortieth Anniversary Vintage Pinot Noir (Central Coast)\tPinot Noir\tCalera\tGT_90_Points\n82633\tItaly\tPinot Grigio doesn't get better than this.

The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure.

Tawny\t93\t770\tPort\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tKopke 1941 Colheita Tawny  (Port)\tPort\tKopke\tGT_90_Points\tWhile this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age. So the acidity and intense wood flavors are dominant, giving a wine that is dry while still very drinkable. It is a Port that is so concentrated and denseƒ??the distillation of a tawny. Drink this impressive wine now.\n28596\tItaly\t\t83\t16\tPiedmont\tBarbera del Monferrato\t\t\t\tBricco dei Guazzi 2006  Barbera del Monferrato\tBarbera\tBricco dei Guazzi\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a one-trick pony, but it's got quite a nice trick. Candied cherry aromas are the opener and follow through on the crisp palate. Little tannin is in evidence on the finish, where cherry flavors are joined by some boysenberry notes. A good choice for pasta in a tomato sauce.\n1255\tSouth Africa\t\t88\t15\tStellenbosch\t\t\tSusan Kostrzewa\t@suskostrzewa\tGuardian Peak 2007 Merlot (Stellenbosch)\tMerlot\tGuardian Peak\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine has a rich, velvety character that gives it solo sipping appeal. Pepper and mocha on the nose flow into dark fruit and mocha flavors on the palate. Paired with a good structure and long finish, the wine is both elegant and intriguing.\n119702\tUS\tMeadow\t88\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tRoss Andrew 2013 Meadow Ros?? (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRos??\tRoss Andrew\tLT_90_Points\t100% Sangiovese, this pale pink wine has notes of bubblegum, wild strawberry and spice. It drinks dry with medium-bodied flavors that linger on the finish.\n74035\tUS\tTen\t93\t82\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tSea Smoke 2014 Ten Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tSea Smoke\tGT_90_Points\tThis richer expression of Pinot Noir kicks off with vanilla and warm cherry sauce on the nose, along with a bit of caramel, enabling it to appeal to lovers of darker red wines. The sip delivers a great depth of berry fruit as well as elegant purple flowers. A chipped-slate minerality is further lifted by dried thyme and bay leaf, making for a hearty but balanced sip.\n18047\tUS\tDiana's\t92\t55\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tTestarossa 2007 Diana's Chardonnay (California)\tChardonnay\tTestarossa\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a blend of Testarossa's far-flung vineyards across California, hence the statewide appellation. It's extraordinarily rich and explosive in apricots, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, buttered toast and smoky, caramelized oak. So muscular that you might want to age it for a year or two, to let it calm down.\n19092\tUS\t\t87\t28\tCalifornia\tLos Carneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGibbs 2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)\tPinot Noir\tGibbs\tLT_90_Points\tPerfumed, bold and brambly, this is a full-bodied and fairly-priced rendition of the variety that's big in cherry cola flavor, earthy mint and oak.\n17513\tChile\tCipreses Vineyard\t89\t25\tSan Antonio\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Marin 2008 Cipreses Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)\tSauvignon Blanc\tCasa Marin\tLT_90_Points\tConvincing and individual across its aromas, flavors and nuances. Casa Marin is a leader in coastal Sauvignon Blanc, and this full-bodied, racy wine grabs your attention with its crisp, pure personality. It is zesty and alive, with apple and green-fruit flavors, while the focused finish isnarrow and committed.

Cracked peppercorn, dried thyme and rosemary combine for strong herbal intrigue on the palate, spicing up the black plum and blackberry fruit.\n57098\tUS\tGap's Crown Vineyard\t90\t75\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGuarachi Family 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tGuarachi Family\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, savory and retentive of tannin and oak, this is a robust, rich and ripe wine, with a tang of dark cherry, cola and vanilla. Youthful, it has ample acidity to keep it fresh in the glass, but allow it to open over time.\n120285\tFrance\t\t95\t\tBordeaux\tMargaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?›teau Palmer 2008  Margaux\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?›teau Palmer\tGT_90_Points\tRich and concentrated, touched easily by toasty wood. The tannins are so sweet, blending easily into the powerful texture of black berry fruits with, hints of licorice. This is a ripe wine, its acidity always present.\n18484\tFrance\t\t86\t39\tRh??ne Valley\tCh?›teauneuf-du-Pape\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDomaine de Nalys 2009 White (Ch?›teauneuf-du-Pape)\tRh??ne-style White Blend\tDomaine de Nalys\tLT_90_Points\tPear and melon flavors are buttressed by ample acid in this medium-bodied white Ch?›teauneuf-du-Pape. For a 2009, it lacks richness but remains a tasty, easy-drinking wine that finishes with a touch of anise.\n48932\tUS\tClockspring Vineyard\t87\t22\tCalifornia\tAmador County\tSierra Foothills\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tAmador Cellars 2010 Clockspring Vineyard Sangiovese (Amador County)\tSangiovese\tAmador Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tLight in color and only just faintly aromatic, Amador Cellars' Sangiovese tastes of red cherry and blueberry with a tight tannin structure that suggests giving it 3ƒ??5 years more time.\n76891\tFrance\tT?¦te de Cru\t92\t44\tBurgundy\tPouilly-Fuiss??\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?›teau de Fuiss?? 2013 T?¦te de Cru  (Pouilly-Fuiss??)\tChardonnay\tCh?›teau de Fuiss??\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is ripe, smooth and rich. It has a generous feel to it, although never far from the more mineral, steely, terroir-driven character that makes good Pouilly-Fuiss??. The top of the range from Ch?›teau de Fuiss??, this wine is selected from 30 different parcels giving an harmonious balance between richness and structure. Age the wine and drink from 2018.\n127606\tAustralia\tCeravolo\t83\t12\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt. Andrews Estate 2000 Ceravolo Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSt. Andrews Estate\tLT_90_Points\tNo oak means that the pear and melon flavors are front and center in this slightly syrupy wine that finishes unexpectedly hard and tart, with metallic notes.\n87194\tItaly\tRosa Regale\t82\t22\tPiedmont\tBrachetto d'Acqui\t\t\t\tVigne Regali 2007 Rosa Regale  (Brachetto d'Acqui)\tBrachetto\tVigne Regali\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of fresh summer fruits are countered by an earthy note whose contribution is questionable. Light on the palate with nice strawberry fruit but turns a bit cloying on the finish. Mousse lacks persistence. Drink now.\n134\tUS\t\t91\t78\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tClark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tClark-Clauden\tGT_90_Points\tGive this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.\n116399\tPortugal\tAzul Portugal\t88\t12\tD?œo\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tWines & Winemakers 2013 Azul Portugal Red (D?œo)\tPortuguese Red\tWines & Winemakers\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Ja??n, Alfrocheiro, Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz is ripe and juicy, with black fruit tones. It does have a structure that will allow the wine to age for a few years, so drink from late 2016.\n103831\tUS\t\t83\t15\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tAcre Twenty-one 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAcre Twenty-one\tLT_90_Points\tThis Cabernet doesn't seem to have fully ripened with notes of jalape?ño pepper, green herbs and cherry with a light styling and gritty tannins.\n31580\tUS\t\t90\t25\tColorado\tGrand Valley\t\tAlexander Peartree\t\tThe Infinite Monkey Theorem 2013 Cabernet Franc (Grand Valley)\tCabernet Franc\tThe Infinite Monkey Theorem\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated cranberry and red currant aromas meet granite and dried herbs on the nose of this 100% Cabernet Franc. A round body of racy currant and blackberry meet a solid core of graphite, while finely-grained tannins give support. This is a well-balanced showing from winemaker Ben Parsons.\n65613\tUS\tMemento\t93\t110\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tFrazier 2009 Memento Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFrazier\tGT_90_Points\tAnother successful Cab from Frazier, following on the heels of the outstanding 2008 vintage. Like that wine, this one is elaborately ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The structure is impeccable, showing firm tannins and fine balancing acidity. Great to drink now, and will age for at least 10 years.\n116498\tItaly\tPiluna\t87\t12\tSouthern Italy\tSalento\t\t\t\tCastello Monaci 2006 Piluna Primitivo (Salento)\tPrimitivo\tCastello Monaci\tLT_90_Points\tA very precise mineral quality that recalls slate roof and granite defines this wine and delivers a linear and drying experience overall. The wine has charm and elegance with lingering spice notes on the finish.\n85736\tItaly\t\t89\t20\tPiedmont\tCoste della Sesia\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tTravaglini 2013 Nebbiolo (Coste della Sesia)\tNebbiolo\tTravaglini\tLT_90_Points\tPolished and fragrant, this charming red offers alluring scents of freshly picked rose, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity and supple tannins balance the bright cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise flavors. Enjoy through 2017.\n34640\tUS\t\t91\t48\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tDouglas Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tPinot Noir\tDouglas Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tThis project led by founder Jocko Douglas makes small batches of compelling wine. This Pinot Noir offers aromas of blackberry-laced tea, mocha and spearmint. The palate shows juicy, plump raspberries and blackberries bolstered by clove, allspice and espresso elements.\n41057\tItaly\tVecchie Vigne Sor?ª Paitin Riserva\t87\t\tPiedmont\tBarbaresco\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tPaitin 2010 Vecchie Vigne Sor?ª Paitin Riserva  (Barbaresco)\tNebbiolo\tPaitin\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of leafy underbrush, cellar floor and crushed herb carry over to a palate of raw red cherry and dried sage.

There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend.

Dark cherry and plum notes form the core of the wine, dressed up by complex hints of mocha, sage blossoms and hickory smoke. It's smooth and streamlined in the mouth, with a long, mouthwatering finish.

It does offer waves of raspberry and blueberry fruit topped by hints of cinnamon and vanilla as well as savory undercurrents of grilled meat and tapenade.

The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.\n54435\tAustralia\tKillerman's Run\t88\t20\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2013 Killerman's Run Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKilikanoon\tLT_90_Points\tLean.

The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.\n35679\tAustralia\tReserve\t92\t50\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenley Estate 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPenley Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.\n88840\tAustralia\t\t84\t9\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDeakin Estate 2008 Moscato (Victoria)\tMoscato\tDeakin Estate\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy and slightly pungent, showing the distinct aromas of underripe Muscat, but the delicate textureƒ??it's lightly sparklingƒ??and sweet flavors win out on the palate, balanced by a fresh, citrusy finish.\n73684\tAustralia\tPolish Hill\t91\t30\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tGrosset 2002 Polish Hill Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tGrosset\tGT_90_Points\tWhether you ask me, God, or the lamp post, anyone who's ever had Australian Riesling will count this among the country's best versions of the variety. On the nose, it yields a little sweetness, plus some grapefruit and passion fruit; after a few minutes in the glass, the passion fruit aromas hold on and are joined by kiwi and other fresh tropical fruit. It's a very dry Riesling, with strong lime and a fresh herbal (perhaps cilantro?) flavors, which makes the mineral foundation seem that much drier and racier. Finishes medium-long with grapefruit and putty flavors.

Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential.

Hints of brown sugar and raisin on the nose give an impression of great ripeness, but that's balanced by fresh black currant, coffee and black olive flavors.

From a mix of granite and the region's famed Cambrian red soils, this wine offers ripe blue and red fruit, florals and a peppery, olivey punch.

Cedary notes frame blueberry and blackberry fruit, picking up nuances of menthol, hickory smoke and mocha along the way.

Oak-derived elements of vanilla and toast frame exotic hints of mango, pineapple and citrus. With its ample weight and plush texture, this wine is a throwback of sorts, yet it manages to achieve that with great focus and citrusy length.\n32434\tAustralia\tThe Wild Ride\t89\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTait Wines 2013 The Wild Ride G-S-M (Barossa Valley)\tG-S-M\tTait Wines\tLT_90_Points\tNot as wild as the name suggests, this is a full-bodied, rather weighty wine, but one that stays within normal bounds.

Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.\n34580\tAustralia\tPremium Cuv??e Brut\t89\t20\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJansz NV Premium Cuv??e Brut Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tLT_90_Points\tToasty and citrusy, this is a prototypical m??thode Champenoise sparkler, blending Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier from the cool island of Tasmania, off Australia's southern coast.

Somewhere between silky and velvety, this full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz finishes long and appears to have the tannic structure to age well, though it's delicious now.\n3547\tAustralia\tIsolation Ridge Vineyard\t92\t40\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrankland Estate 2012 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)\tRiesling\tFrankland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tAn austere Riesling in the traditional Australian style, the 2012 Isolation Ridge Riesling appears destined to have a long life.

Full-bodied with powdery tannins, it has flavors of honeydew, peach fuzz and mineral, and an herbal-peppery finish that lingers on the tongue. Nose is a tantalizing mix of marzipan, jasmine and clover. Just excellent.\n87137\tAustralia\t\t95\t84\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoss Wood 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMoss Wood\tGT_90_Points\tPerhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness. The finish lingers, with a supple, dreamy character that speaks to a gentle climate and careful winemaking.

It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.\n127594\tAustralia\tSoldier's Block Vineyard\t83\t9\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMarktree 1999 Soldier's Block Vineyard Chardonnay (Australia)\tChardonnay\tMarktree\tLT_90_Points\tStarts off decently, with menthol-toast aromas of new oak layered over apple and lime fruit. Then turns overly oaky on the palate, blending caramel, toast and dill flavors with tart apple, finishing off with a slice of lemony acidity.\n293\tAustralia\tGreen's Vineyard\t92\t70\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.\n117983\tAustralia\tRSW\t90\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2013 RSW Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar.

It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish.\n36422\tAustralia\tBoarding Pass\t87\t20\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tR Wines 2007 Boarding Pass Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tR Wines\tLT_90_Points\tA bit spicier than the other R Wines Shirazes, the 2007 Boarding Pass features mainly McLaren Vale fruit, offering blackberry tinged with coffee and peppery spice.

The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5ƒ??10 years. Slightly honeyed notes soften the intense scents of crushed stones, then pick up hints of tangerine on the palate. Replacing the briskness of youth is a soft, lingering finish.\n48434\tAustralia\tLuna de Fresca Biodynamic Tempranillo\t88\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGemtree 2016 Luna de Fresca Biodynamic Tempranillo Ros??

Forty percent of the base wine is barrel-fermented, imparting a rich, cashew character that's augmented by two years of aging on lees. It's a complex, medium-bodied wine that's a departure from most New World sparklers.\n77718\tAustralia\t\t83\t5\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBanrock Station 2006 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)\tChardonnay\tBanrock Station\tLT_90_Points\tPossibly a little sweet, this is a soft, easygoing Chardonnay marked by clean, modest pear and melon flavors.\n17810\tAustralia\tWinemaker's\t84\t14\tAustralia Other\tAustralia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWildling 2013 Winemaker's Red (Australia)\tRed Blend\tWildling\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-bodied red is a bit obvious and confected, but delivers ample cassis fruit without any obvious structure to support it.

Notes of smoke, lemon, melon, vanilla oak and a slight vegetal character lead into a nicely textured palate and a long, smokey finish.

Smith\tGT_90_Points\tBill Smith is better known for his Pinot Noirs, but he founded La Jota and knows a thing or two about Howell Mountain Cabs. This is a big, dry, tannic mountain wine, virtually undrinkable now for its hard astringency. However, it's a fine cellar candidate. Brims with ripe blackberries and cherries that just need time. Should begin to open in 2008, and develop for another 8 years or so.\n113199\tUS\tSeccopassa 'Appassimento'\t88\t45\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tTre Nova 2006 Seccopassa 'Appassimento' Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSangiovese\tTre Nova\tLT_90_Points\tThis is intended as an Amarone-style wine, made from half Sangiovese and half Barbera.

Aromas and flavors of ripe forest berries give way to dried hay and streaks of graphite. Silky upon entry, the midplalate is supported by sandy, soft tannins and a driving acid backbone.\n65920\tUS\tHyland Vineyard Legacy\t89\t100\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tSol??na 2014 Hyland Vineyard Legacy Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\tPinot Noir\tSol??na\tLT_90_Points\tA single barrel is all that is made.

Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.\n36593\tUS\tAnnadel Gap Vineyard Estate\t92\t36\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tWestwood 2014 Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Roussanne-Viognier (Sonoma Valley)\tRoussanne-Viognier\tWestwood\tGT_90_Points\tThis combination of 63% Roussanne with 37% Viognier goes through native fermentation and given time in neutral oak, making for a refined, light-bodied white pungent in pretty honeysuckle.

There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.\n122533\tUS\tSleepy Hollow Vineyard\t90\t42\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTalbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tChardonnay\tTalbott\tGT_90_Points\tAnother fine Chardonnay from this producer.

Thus, it's a field blend of the type that Italian-American vintners produced throughout much of the 20th century.

It's gigantic in mineral-infused blackberries and black currants; the flavors are deep, intense and long-lasting into the finish. An impressive wine whose astringency requires aging, hold this until 2017, at the very least.\n80670\tUS\tTango Oaks Vineyard\t91\t20\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

It's dry and tannic and well-structured, and rich in blackberry, currant, cherry and plum fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It provides a good showcase for the emerging Coombsville region.

Spectacularly complex, it offers a wealth of cherries, currants, orange zest, plum, fig, tea, clove and cinnamon flavors that, for all their power, never lose a sense of elegance and purity. Practically a food group of its own, this is a great California Pinot Noir.\n121818\tUS\t\t92\t24\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tDi Bruno 2016 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County)\tPinot Grigio\tDi Bruno\tGT_90_Points\tThere's the ever-so-slight touch of pink to the glass in this bottling by Bruno D'Alfonso, who packs strong and fresh aromas of cider apples, chalk, tangerine zest, pear flesh and light jasmine on the nose.

It has rich flavors of blackberries and blueberries, and seems far younger than it is. It's interesting and complex, and grows in the glass. Could go for a few more years.\n17996\tUS\tGodspeed\t94\t95\tCalifornia\tMount Veeder\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSbragia 2013 Godspeed Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSbragia\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish.\n41245\tUS\tBien Nacido Vineyard Block Eleven\t91\t60\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tLa Fen?¦tre 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block Eleven Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)\tChardonnay\tLa Fen?¦tre\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse.\n91649\tUS\tLos Caballos Vineyard\t91\t46\tCalifornia\tTemecula Valley\tSouth Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLeoness 2013 Los Caballos Vineyard Merlot (Temecula Valley)\tMerlot\tLeoness\tGT_90_Points\tCandied blueberry, vanilla bean, dried dill and anise make for a very approachable and layered nose on this bottling from winemaker Tim Kramer, a mentor to many in the region.

Tastes like the essence of blackberries, sprinkled with black pepper, anise and cocoa. As rich as it is, the finish is perfectly dry. There's a rusticity to the texture, but that's why Zinfandel is Zinfandel. Drink over the next six years, especially with barbecue or fine roasted meats and root vegetables.\n27776\tUS\tTusculum Estate\t90\t44\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tVista Hills 2008 Tusculum Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\tPinot Noir\tVista Hills\tGT_90_Points\tVista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.\n42466\tUS\tEstate BlackJack\t90\t55\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tDavid Hill 2010 Estate BlackJack Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tDavid Hill\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage.\n127459\tUS\tGold Ridge Hills\t93\t30\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\t\t\tSonoma Coast Vineyards 2010 Gold Ridge Hills Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)\tChardonnay\tSonoma Coast Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tThis winery has a good track record for producing rich, opulent Chardonnays. The cool 2010 vintage was beneficial, yielding a low alcohol wine with extraordinarily rich tropical fruit flavors and bright, graceful acidity. It saw a majority of new French oak, lending it a note of buttered toast, but the underlying wine is so big, it easily handles that weight.\n24493\tUS\tFlorence Vineyard\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tCarol Shelton 2013 Florence Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tCarol Shelton\tGT_90_Points\tThis Zin specialist shows she knows her way around this hearty variety as well, creating a wine that's expressive in voluptuous notions of chocolate and blackberry pie. Soft and smoky, it shows ripeness balanced by underlying acidity and a wisp of black licorice as it goes down.\n115143\tUS\tPlus Game Ranch\t92\t150\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tGoldschmidt 2011 Plus Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tGoldschmidt\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a delightfully dense, yet herbal and well-structured wine, 100% varietal, with still-chewy tannins that integrate in the glass. Cassis and tea highlight the experience. The wine is sourced from a prime spot in the heart of the Napa Valley known for both its exuberance of fruit and classic elegance.\n115169\tUS\tBrut Ros??\t91\t24\tCalifornia\tNapa County\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tMumm Napa NV Brut Ros??

Strawberry, dried cherries, sage and herbs combine for unique, memorable flavors.\n103760\tUS\tLPF\t90\t65\tCalifornia\tAdelaida District\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tThe Farm Winery 2013 LPF Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tThe Farm Winery\tGT_90_Points\tThis bottling, which is enhanced by 2% Petit Verdot, shows deep black plum, dark chocolate and bright strawberry touches with a slight hint of barnyard on the nose. The latter element carries into the palate as well, adding nuance to the black cherry, fennel and milk chocolate flavors, all wrapped in firm tannins.\n16724\tUS\tRidgecrest Vineyards Reserve\t90\t70\tOregon\tRibbon Ridge\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tChehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)\tPinot Noir\tChehalem\tGT_90_Points\tFlavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.\n2301\tUS\tReserve\t90\t75\tCalifornia\tHowell Mountain\tNapa\t\t\tHighlands 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHighlands\tGT_90_Points\tCompared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.\n2303\tUS\tConner Lee Vineyard\t90\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tArbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))\tChardonnay\tArbor Crest\tGT_90_Points\tThis big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.\n93247\tUS\tTrenton Estate\t92\t52\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tJoseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Trenton Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tJoseph Swan Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tAt two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young. Should be more harmonious toward the end of 2009, and evolve for many years after.\n49999\tUS\tDr. Wolfe's Family Red\t90\t15\tWashington\tWashington\tWashington Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tThurston Wolfe 2009 Dr. Wolfe's Family Red Red (Washington)\tRed Blend\tThurston Wolfe\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range.\n48746\tUS\t\t92\t38\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLombardi 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tLombardi\tGT_90_Points\tThis lovely, luxurious wine hails from the Terra de Promissio Vineyard. It stands out for its thickness of earthy forest floor and exuberant fruit, a mix of candied raspberry, blueberry and cherry. Building structure and power as it opens in the glass, it finishes strongly tannic, suggesting more time in the cellar may be of benefit; hold through 2023.\n45328\tUS\tGowan Creek Vineyard\t93\t82\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tGoldeneye 2013 Gowan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)\tPinot Noir\tGoldeneye\tGT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied and beautifully flavored wine goes deep in terms of ripe fruit and subtle spices, and has a calm, composed character and ultrasmooth, slightly restrained texture.

All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too.

The cool vintage has brought out a tannic earthiness, as well as a blast of black pepper that makes the blackberry and blueberry fruit tingly on the tongue. It's a complicated, individualistic wine, and you might want to cellar it for up to six years and see what happens.\n51381\tUS\t\t94\t40\tCalifornia\tChalk Hill\tSonoma\t\t\tChalk Hill 2008 Sauvignon Gris (Chalk Hill)\tSauvignon Gris\tChalk Hill\tGT_90_Points\tA gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging.

Bright, tart, ripe and compact red-berry fruit is set against firm, polished tannins. Still young and hard, it needs plenty of breathing time, or better yet, cellar it for a few years.

But Washington state has some Chenin vines approaching 30 years of age, and that fruit is the centerpiece of this ripe, round, floral and slightly spritzy offering from Pacific Rim. Fruit flavors of ripe pear and key lime make this a vivacious and lip-smacking crowd-pleaser, lifted with natural acids and finished at just 12.5% alcohol.\n127105\tUS\tVintage Reserve\t83\t28\tVirginia\tVirginia\t\t\t\tThe Williamsburg Winery 2006 Vintage Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia)\tChardonnay\tThe Williamsburg Winery\tLT_90_Points\tThis straightforward wine is crisp and refreshing.

It tastes and smells of mushroom compost, with no hint of any definitive fruit, no suggestion of varietal character. Two bottles tasted, same results.\n92328\tUS\tCentral Park West Vineyard\t89\t50\tCalifornia\tSt. Helena\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tTrinchero 2011 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTrinchero\tLT_90_Points\tThis explodes in sizable red cassis and berry fruit along with darker shades of blackberry and espresso.

Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.\n48823\tUS\tNicholas Vineyard\t90\t22\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tRain Dance 2016 Nicholas Vineyard Riesling (Chehalem Mountains)\tRiesling\tRain Dance\tGT_90_Points\tThis dry-tasting Riesling contains only 6.6 g/L of residual sugar.

It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog.\n125515\tUS\tChristian's Reserve\t90\t45\tCalifornia\tLake County\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tSix Sigma Ranch 2010 Christian's Reserve Tempranillo (Lake County)\tTempranillo\tSix Sigma Ranch\tGT_90_Points\tThis full-bodied but agile wine combines smoky, toasty, peppery aromas with tasty black currant and dark chocolate flavors that remain on the austere side, but promise good development through at least 2018. The texture is tannic, but the mouthfeel is not harsh, conveying plenty of power gently contained.\n127518\tUS\tBrix Vineyard Estate Grown\t90\t88\tCalifornia\tOakville\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tKelleher 2012 Brix Vineyard Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKelleher\tGT_90_Points\tSoft and silky, this wine shows rich chocolate flavor and is light in oak and fleshy on the palate.

It shows a little herb and loam in the midpalate, and that pretty fruit fades away gently, leaving a harmonious, give-me-another-sip aftertaste.\n37260\tUS\t\t88\t10\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tTwin Arches 2010 Merlot (California)\tMerlot\tTwin Arches\tLT_90_Points\tThis mellowed-out red is ready to drink now. A good level of flavor complexity and a layered texture that is smooth but firm with tannins make this medium-bodied Merlot tasty. It feels so soothing and appetizing that one forgives the fruit and spice notes for being subtle.\n101293\tUS\tBella Rossa Italian Style\t83\t18\tCalifornia\tFair Play\tSierra Foothills\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tCharles B. Mitchell NV Bella Rossa Italian Style Red (Fair Play)\tRed Blend\tCharles B.

Though still quite young and tight, the mix of ripe fruits, brown spices, cedar and smoke make for a beguiling nose that promises a long life ahead. Silky and elegant, but let it breathe or better yet cellar it for another half decade.\n76572\tUS\tCara Mia Vineyard Bel Canto\t95\t60\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tCadence 2010 Cara Mia Vineyard Bel Canto Red (Red Mountain)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCadence\tGT_90_Points\tThe best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy.\n93616\tUS\tHighland Estates Trace Ridge\t94\t70\tCalifornia\tKnights Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tKendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Trace Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKendall-Jackson\tGT_90_Points\tA gorgeous Cab that shows the density and concentration, but also the elegant structure, of a fine mountain vineyard. Dry and richly tannic, this 100% Cabernet has pinpoint flavors of currants, plums and cedar.

The blendƒ??two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrahƒ??is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.\n74122\tUS\tEstate\t90\t25\tCalifornia\tEl Dorado\tSierra Foothills\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tMiraflores 2009 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado)\tZinfandel\tMiraflores\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a proper El Dorado Zin. It's still tight and tannic, but air and time reveal a lovely bouquet of lavender and crushed herbs that's layered, soft and spicy on the finish. Miraflores is making some lovely wines and this is one worth seeking out.\n49881\tUS\t\t90\t19\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tArdenvoir 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSauvignon Blanc\tArdenvoir\tGT_90_Points\tThis captures the essential flavors of Washington Sauvignon Blanc. There are no aggressive grassy-herbal flavors, none of the vegetal or canned pea flavors that show up in other New World Sauv Blancs.

Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying.\n18461\tUS\tSpirit Canyon Vineyard\t92\t21\tCalifornia\tMendocino County\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tBriceland 2016 Spirit Canyon Vineyard Arneis (Mendocino County)\tArneis\tBriceland\tGT_90_Points\tGreat balance and a charming lighter character make this lightly floral wine especially enjoyable.

Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Carmen??re, its most notable feature is tannins. It's hard, dry and astringent, making it difficult to appreciate now. But there's a gigantic core of blackberries and black currants. With richness like this, it should age and improve through 2020 at least.\n69466\tUS\tNo. 239 Single Vineyard\t92\t19\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

It's got a nice full body to it, with some creaminess in the mouth. Proper acids and a good application of oak keep it balanced. Bridgeview has a knack for making well-priced Pinot Noir that's fruity, friendly and complex enough to satisfy those who know and love the grape.

The wine is dry, crisp and clean, with complex flavors of raspberry jam, pomegranates and heirloom tomatoes, which lend a satisfying earthiness to the fruit.

Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee.

The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.\n50573\tUS\tClone 115\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tArroyo Grande Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tOrfila 2012 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)\tPinot Noir\tOrfila\tGT_90_Points\tA pleasurable, single-clone Pinot Noir.

This is the first release from these grapes. A Rh??ne blend (61% Syrah, 34% Grenache, 5% Mourv??dre), it's aromatically captivating, with a fascinating mix of violets and stones. The wine itself seems carved out of rock, its flavors in bas-relief.

It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.\n123585\tUS\tReserve\t91\t65\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tRutherford Hill 2009 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley)\tMerlot\tRutherford Hill\tGT_90_Points\tWhile this doesn't quite rival the great 2007, it is superior to the 2008.

Tart wild berry fruit is cut with sharp acids, and laced with herb and hints of stone. There is a bit of saddle leather showing through the tannins, but not so much as to wipe out the sweet fruit.

This could use more time; try after 2016.\n120739\tSpain\tEl Circo Volatinero\t86\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos 2015 El Circo Volatinero Tempranillo (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy gritty berry aromas come with a hint of animal. This is juicy and in good shape across the palate, while bright plum and berry flavors are dusted with spice and chocolate notes. A wiry finish with lightly medicinal berry flavors shows kick.\n69411\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Egu??a 2014 Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tVi?ña Egu??a\tLT_90_Points\tZesty cherry aromas are offset by powdery softness and floral hints. This feels solid and correct, with bright acidity. Flavors of red-apple skins and citrus fruits finish direct and clean.\n59065\tSpain\t\t84\t20\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPeique 2013 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tPeique\tLT_90_Points\tPithy citrus aromas are heavy and strangely herbal for a white wine. Pulpy and wide in feel, with little midpalate structure, this tastes of citrus rind, white grapefruit and nopal. A zesty note reprises on the finish.\n51524\tSpain\tSentido\t86\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNeo 2007 Sentido  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tNeo\tLT_90_Points\tFloral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors. There's an abundance of pop and snap to this medium-bodied wine, and then drying woody notes to the finish.\n47619\tSpain\tLaya Old Vines\t87\t9\tCentral Spain\tAlmansa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAtalaya 2010 Laya Old Vines Garnacha-Monastrell (Almansa)\tGarnacha-Monastrell\tAtalaya\tLT_90_Points\tLeather, plum and berry aromas form a nice opening as minty chocolate notes emerge. It feels spunky, with edgy, rubbery tannins and full flavors of plum, cherry, mint and herb. Dry and controlled on the finish, this has an overall fresh character. Mostly Garnacha with some Monastrell.\n94670\tSpain\t3\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGabarda NV 3 Red (Cari?ñena)\tRed Blend\tGabarda\tLT_90_Points\tFleshy cherry and lightly green, herbal aromas lead to a crisp, tight palate. This tastes a little leafy and herbal, with raspberry notes. The finish is fresh, dry, and composed, but not overly intense or focused.\n10187\tSpain\tSpiga\t87\t31\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tO. Fournier 2008 Spiga  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto del Pais\tO. Fournier\tLT_90_Points\tTight and gritty on the bouquet, with licorice and herbal aromas. Comes across hard and tannic in the mouth, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Tannic like nails on the finish, with lemony oak notes.\n114413\tSpain\tO Rosal\t88\t24\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerras Gauda 2007 O Rosal Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tTerras Gauda\tLT_90_Points\tOn the brink of excellence, with a creamy, more funky nose courtesy of the 30% Loureira and Cai?ño Blanco added to Albari?ño. Flavors of ripe tropical fruits show light green accents, while the finish is steady and a little pithy. Perfectly good white wine, with a punch-like quality. Imported by A.V.

Drink immediately.\n106671\tSpain\t\t83\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz de Piedra 2013 Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tCruz de Piedra\tLT_90_Points\tFunky aromas of animal fur and lively berry are not that inviting. In the mouth, this has a narrow feel and high acidity. Herbal, tart flavors of plum and red currant are almost sour, while the finish is on the green and herbal side.\n30565\tSpain\tLo Mon\t88\t38\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrossos del Priorat 2010 Lo Mon Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tTrossos del Priorat\tLT_90_Points\tJammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla.

Feels like orange juice on the palate and tastes like orange and tangerine. Cleansing, fresh enough and easy to drink.\n47946\tSpain\t\t88\t20\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHeredad Soliterra 2006 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tHeredad Soliterra\tLT_90_Points\tRaisin and other sweet, soft aromas are friendly but don't really bring it. The palate follows suit; it's chubby and jammy, with sweet berry flavors, a touch of raisin and a roasted, candied finish. Very nice and true to the region, albeit on the soft and easy side.\n80153\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Emperatriz 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca La Emperatriz\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy generic berry aromas come with an herbal component and a note of licorice root. This feels tight and compact, but not overly ripe. Berry fruit flavors are herbal and the slightest bit green, with a black-pepper note in front of a rubbery finish with clamping tannins.\n110990\tSpain\tRayuelo\t84\t20\tCentral Spain\tManchuela\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltolandon 2013 Rayuelo Bobal (Manchuela)\tBobal\tAltolandon\tLT_90_Points\tThis Bobal's roasted berry and funky animal aromas hardly lay down the red carpet. Its dry spice and oak flavors smother berry and plum fruit, tasting herbal and minty on a heavy, grippy finish.\n91213\tSpain\tJME Selecci??n\t86\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2008 JME Selecci??n  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky and dark on the nose, with crusty black fruit aromas. It's short and tough in the mouth, with beaming acidity but only monoline red berry flavors. High acidity rears up again on the finish. Reflects the tough conditions of 2008.\n35913\tSpain\tCrianza\t91\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tResalte 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tResalte\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, earthy aromas of cola, coconut, blackberry and cassis are healthy and heady. Reflecting a warm year, this wine feels both flush and fleshy, with mild tannins. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and coffee finish clean, open and easy, with nothing overbearing. Drink through 2019.\n2470\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t90\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEduardo Garrido Garc??a 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tEduardo Garrido Garc??a\tGT_90_Points\tStrawberry and raspberry aromas are a touch briny. This is lively in the mouth, with lasting acidity that offers kick to an aged Rioja. Spicy notes of pepper sit on top of base-level cherry and plum fruit, while toast and spice flavors along with lasting acidity drive the finish.\n96100\tSpain\tEl Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sindoa 2010 El Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tVega Sindoa\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a dark bomber with black cherry, kirsch, lemony oak and shoe polish aromas. The palate is creamy and big, with acid-derived lift boosting blackberry and licorice flavors. With tons of black-fruit character, this qualifies as a fruit-forward wine with sweet overtones.\n59570\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Circulo 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tEl Circulo\tLT_90_Points\tSort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is angular and clipped by piercing acidity, while the flavors are of nice but regular black cherry and plum. Fairly juicy and fresh as a whole.\n21068\tSpain\tBelezos\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Zugober 2010 Belezos  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Zugober\tLT_90_Points\tThe first whiff of this Rioja is full of oaky char, shoe polish, raw leather and can't-miss wood resin. With airing the nose cedes chocolate and berry scents. This is plump, chewy and a touch resiny feeling on the palate, with baked berry, savory notes, grilled meat flavors and saltiness. A roasted, rubbery finish is apropos.\n111435\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTape?ña 2010 Ros?? (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRos??\tTape?ña\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral, dusty and a bit damp-smelling, with a leanness to the palate feel as well as flavors of semitart melon and peach. Decent but fails to excite. Drink now.\n99913\tSpain\tJaloco Roble\t82\t12\tCentral Spain\tRibera del Guadiana\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Medina 2011 Jaloco Roble Red (Ribera del Guadiana)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Medina\tLT_90_Points\tJammy and candied smelling, this has a green element akin to alfalfa or mint. It's clampy, tannic and high in acid, with raspberry and plum notes that offer an oak offset. The flavors turn tangy and sharp on the finish, even as a heavy vanilla flavor settles in.\n92405\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t27\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrus 2011 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tTrus\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up.\n952\tSpain\tXIC\t87\t16\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Pened??s)\tXarel-lo\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata\tLT_90_Points\tDusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.\n98095\tSpain\tAgricultura Ecol??gica\t89\t50\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOssian 2014 Agricultura Ecol??gica Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tVerdejo\tOssian\tLT_90_Points\tMature corny aromas of tortilla chips are particular and require a lot of air and swirling to show their best. This barrel-fermented old-vines Verdejo shows lightly oxidized flavors along with oak and apple. On the finish, this is plump, oaky and a bit bready tasting. Drink now.\n77902\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVivanco 2014 Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tVivanco\tLT_90_Points\tThis rusty colored rosado is flat and neutral on the nose. In the mouth, it's full but also flabby, while slightly bitter stone-fruit and melon flavors finish long but with a lashing of bitterness and burn.\n68633\tSpain\tCordon Negro Extra Dry\t85\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tLime, apple and iodine aromas are the opening act for a low-acid, powdery palate with mealy green-fruit flavors. Briny notes of pickled cucumber and lettuce drive the finish alongside lemon-lime notes.\n9372\tSpain\tSolaz Blanco\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne 2006 Solaz Blanco Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tViura\tOsborne\tLT_90_Points\tVibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon. It stretches astringency to its limit, and yet some may like it because it will never be confused for plodding.\n65316\tSpain\tRoble\t88\t10\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Hispana 2011 Roble Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tFinca Hispana\tLT_90_Points\tJammy, gritty berry aromas set up a rubbery, full-force palate that doesn't tread lightly. Roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors finish firm. Overall, this feels right, while the flavors run a touch baked, rustic and stalky.\n18633\tSpain\t\t82\t10\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTarantas 2014 Sparkling (Valencia)\tSparkling Blend\tTarantas\tLT_90_Points\tApple and lime aromas are basic and distant. This is light on the palate, while green melon, lime, apple and green-bean flavors finish grassy, leesy, tart and bitter.\n106606\tSpain\tVi?ña Sanzo\t83\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValsanzo 2005 Vi?ña Sanzo Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tValsanzo\tLT_90_Points\tYellow in color, with floral, citrusy aromas. Not a whole lot of definition to the palate; it's wet but dilute, with unrefined, nonproprietary citrus flavors.\n6492\tSpain\tMonastrell-Tempranillo\t82\t10\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques Escriba 2013 Monastrell-Tempranillo Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tMarques Escriba\tLT_90_Points\tWiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish.\n42848\tSpain\tSobre Lias\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Somoza 2012 Sobre Lias Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tVi?ña Somoza\tLT_90_Points\tNectarine and brine are the lead aromas, but there's also a sense of toasty oak that is lees-based. A creamy, resiny mouthfeel and flavors of briny citrus fruits and melon finish firm and snappy.\n62681\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTaron 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tTaron\tLT_90_Points\tDusty berry aromas blend with mint and herbal notes. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched; flavors of baked black fruits, vanilla and dill are earthy on the finish, which is chunky but generally balanced.\n32076\tSpain\t7\t88\t35\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2007 +7 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tPinord\tLT_90_Points\tThe bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas. The palate is one part jumpy and another part stewy and clumsy, with baked berry flavors that come with a tangy citric edge. The finish is long, with tobacco, stewed fruit and hard tannins. Drink now through 2015.\n21682\tSpain\tMinimum\t85\t75\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rafael Cambra 2005 Minimum Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Rafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tLots of color but quiet and shy, with only minimal expressiveness throughout. The palate offers just one level of baked-fruit flavors, but no variance or complexity. And in the end it's clean and solid, but more amorphous and monotone than you'd hope for given the price. 70% Monastrell and 30% Cab Franc is the blend; 160 cases made.\n95026\tSpain\tLa Tarara Crianza\t89\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tObalo 2013 La Tarara Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tObalo\tLT_90_Points\tRipe berry and oaky vanilla aromas lead to a tight, tannic palate with some scrape to it. Dark, toasty, oak-based flavors of coffee rest on top of plum and currant. It's full on the finish, with a lasting note of toasty oak.\n56183\tSpain\t\t81\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Solar 2011 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tViura\tCasa Solar\tLT_90_Points\tOdd aromas of talcum powder and bath oils are fragrant but not very wine-like. This is flat on the palate, with very little cut and oily tasting flavors of ripe white fruits.\n75404\tSpain\tProtocolo\t86\t7\tCentral Spain\tTierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Eguren 2007 Protocolo Red (Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tDominio de Eguren\tLT_90_Points\tMagenta-colored, berry loaded and fresh, all of which help what could be a pedestrian wine reach a higher plane. Sweet cherry and plum flavors mix with snappy acidity and good structure, and overall you get a refreshing, satisfying wine with genuine appeal.\n16462\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVerdes Castros 2009 Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tVerdes Castros\tLT_90_Points\tStony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland. The finish indicates that it's starting to bend and will break sooner rather than later. Drink now.\n64314\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNita 2010 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tNita\tLT_90_Points\tA touch scratchy on the bouquet, with a red berry aroma and a wild herb note. It feels fresh and decidedly ƒ??redƒ?� in style, with red plum and red currant flavors. More easygoing than brooding, this finishes light. Drink now through 2015.\n124037\tSpain\tBrut Nature\t83\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBiutiful NV Brut Nature Macabeo-Chardonnay (Cava)\tMacabeo-Chardonnay\tBiutiful\tLT_90_Points\tBriny, minerally, dusty aromas of white currant and crushed vitamins set up a foamy, lazy palate.

This has a tannic abrasive mouthfeel in which nothing is smooth. Borderline overripe flavors of baked plum and blackberry finish chocolaty and with baking-spice flavors.\n76350\tSpain\tNorte\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tInurrieta 2010 Norte Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Navarra)\tMerlot-Cabernet Sauvignon\tInurrieta\tLT_90_Points\tRipe plum and berry aromas are straightforward but welcoming. This is a tight, wiry blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that's narrow in feel but full of flavor, particularly plum, blackberry, chocolate and spice. A peppery finish shows juicy acidity and warmth.\n30703\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Legarda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s de Legarda\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry, chocolate and plum aromas form a basic bouquet. This shows tight grip along with flavors of baked berry fruits, leather and earth. The finish tastes a bit rubbery, and then heat and dry, peppery notes take over.\n81044\tSpain\tSingle Vineyard Vi?ña del Olivo\t89\t147\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tContino 2005 Single Vineyard Vi?ña del Olivo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tContino\tLT_90_Points\tPut this wine through its paces and see if you also find overdone oak and salty resin as well as tangy but bulky fruit, herbal hints and bouncy acidity. It gets better with airing, which leads us to believe that this wine's best days are still ahead of it.\n119185\tSpain\tWhite Label\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFaustino Rivero Ulecia 2013 White Label  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFaustino Rivero Ulecia\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a spunky, jumpy Tempranillo with horsey aromas of cherry and plum.

This has a dry raw mouthfeel and flavors that are far more woody and like a campfire than fruity. It's ultradry and pulling on the finish.\n92440\tSpain\t\t81\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCubo 2006 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tCubo\tLT_90_Points\tIf it weren't for a pretty well-balanced mouthfeel, this would be pushing daisies. It smells like green beans and a used ashtray, with murky green fruit and milk chocolate flavors backing that up. As we said, mouthfeel is good; aromas and flavors not so much.\n79971\tSpain\tDiamante Semi Dulce\t83\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas 2011 Diamante Semi Dulce White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of white gum drop and funky yeast set up a slightly cloying palate, with a candied flavor of pear.

A blend of Malvasia and Viura.\n121468\tSpain\tReserva Brut Ros??\t87\t22\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLlopart 2007 Reserva Brut Ros??

It's mouthfilling and oaky, with toasty, dark, baked-fruit flavors that lead to a finish defined by licorice and clove.

The nose is a bit harsh and strange, while the palate is on the flat side. Flavors of ham, pithy citrus and nectarine finish jumbled. This is more of a unique oddity than great white wine.\n77340\tSpain\t\t91\t18\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontg?? 2012 Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tMontg??\tGT_90_Points\tDusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful.

This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins. Stalky flavors of herbal raspberry and plum come with oaky vanilla accents and tomatoey spice on the finish.\n60182\tSpain\tPalacio de Arganza Tempranillo-Mencia\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinos de Arganza 2012 Palacio de Arganza Tempranillo-Mencia Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tRed Blend\tVinos de Arganza\tLT_90_Points\tDark aromas of asphalt, lead pencil, blackberry, toast and lemony oak lead to a raring, zesty palate with toasty, racy cherry and currant flavors.

On the palate, this feels strained, with outsized acidity. Herbal, roasted wild-berry flavors come with a lot of oak and clove, while the finish is fairly tart and herbal.\n120579\tSpain\tTrenzado\t88\t22\tSpanish Islands\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSuertes del Marqu??s 2015 Trenzado White\tWhite Blend\tSuertes del Marqu??s\tLT_90_Points\tHailing from the volcanic soils of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, this blend of Pedro Xim??nez and List?­n Blanco opens with aromas of citrus peel and honey.

A dry, lightly salty finish maintains integrity.\n67944\tSpain\t\t89\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAnalivia 2009 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tAnalivia\tLT_90_Points\tNice and fresh, and definitely the best vintage of Analivia we've tasted to date. The nose bursts with floral aromas, apricot, apple and minerality, while the palate is clean as a whistle, with apple, tangerine and pineapple flavors. Slightly pithy on the finish, but that's normal for Verdejo from Rueda.\n6076\tSpain\tAbadia de San Campio\t89\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerras Gauda 2014 Abadia de San Campio Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tTerras Gauda\tLT_90_Points\tMinerality and stone-fruit aromas dominate the nose on this pointed, acid-driven Galician white.

It's soft, raisiny and borderline overripe. The flavors are roasted and short, with low acidity, soft tannins and plenty of toast and coffee on the black finish.

What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream.\n64838\tSpain\tReserva\t91\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ñamada 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ñamada\tGT_90_Points\tMore traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit.

This is yet another excellent wine from Clos Berenguer. The nose is full of butterscotch and oxidized aromas of fine Sherry. The palate has a big feel, purity and fine acidity, while flavors of smoke, toast and oxidized white fruits finish waxy, creamy, oaky and long. This Garnacha-heavy blend would go great with fish or lobster done in a butter sauce.\n29067\tSpain\tPintoresco\t86\t9\tCentral Spain\tExtremadura\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga 2009 Pintoresco Tempranillo (Extremadura)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy and dense up front, with dark, forceful aromas.

At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here. But if you can find the pleasure in Txakoli, then this one is good. It has peach and nectarine aromas, which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors.

Flavors of baked black fruits are gritty and mildly stalky, while the finish tastes of cooked berry fruits and generic blackness.\n129789\tSpain\tClisos Reserva\t89\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFederico Paternina 2006 Clisos Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFederico Paternina\tLT_90_Points\tDark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune.

This Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo blend weighs in as heavy and chunky. Flavors of grape skins, bitter melon and honey lose steam on a spent, oxidized finish. While this still has some good qualities, its best days have passed.\n11912\tSpain\t\t92\t50\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlto Moncayo 2013 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tAlto Moncayo\tGT_90_Points\tLike its brothers Veraton and Aquilon, this modern Garnacha opens with hickory, savory berry and balsamic aromas.

A concentrated, minerally, toasty black-fruit nose sets up blackberry, boysenberry, prune, juniper and beef jerky flavors. On the finish, it's sultry, dark and peppery.

Briny, leesy flavors are salty and complex, not your typical apple-pear-and-fizz combination. A briny, low-fruit finish turns increasingly savory and like seashells the longer this sits. Drink now.\n50136\tSpain\tMonte Real Gran Reserva\t94\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 1998 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tFloral cherry, raspberry and aged wood aromas are elegant and mature. This Rioja is in regal condition, with smooth tannins and integrated acidity. Dried cherry, red plum, herbs and vanilla create a classic Rioja flavor profile. A supple, long finish puts this in perfect drinking shape, which doesn't mean it can't last another through 2025 or so.\n43986\tSpain\tAd Libitum\t82\t40\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuan Carlos Sancha 2008 Ad Libitum  (Rioja)\tMaturana\tJuan Carlos Sancha\tLT_90_Points\tAll indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.\n82618\tSpain\tMediterranean White\t83\t6\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRen?? Barbier NV Mediterranean White White (Catalunya)\tWhite Blend\tRen?? Barbier\tLT_90_Points\tBy the sheer fact that this wine costs $6 and never really goes up in price, it holds onto its tenuous value status via clean tropical aromas and mild flavors of lime, pineapple and citrus. It's a touch hot and burning on the finish, but finish isn't what you're banking on with a wine like this. Imported by Freixenet, USA.\n50466\tSpain\tDrysack Medium\t87\t15\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tWilliams & Humbert NV Drysack Medium Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tWilliams & Humbert\tLT_90_Points\tWelcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid and not too overtly sweet, and the finish is coated with burnt brown sugar. Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill.\n21699\tSpain\t\t85\t15\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Molinet 2006 Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tEl Molinet\tLT_90_Points\tDark and crusty on the nose, with cola, raisin and foresty dampness. The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness. Overall it's a good but not overwhelming wine from the hidden Valencia D.O. 70% Tempranillo and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.\n42196\tSpain\t\t80\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLove 2015 Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tChardonnay\tLove\tLT_90_Points\tThis yeasty funky Chardonnay is on its last legs.

This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah is minerally and full of red fruit and vanilla aromas. The palate is husky but correct, with full tannins, a kick of acidity and pure, ripe berry flavors. Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.\n2140\tSpain\t\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGorrebusto 2015  Rioja\tTempranillo\tGorrebusto\tLT_90_Points\tCandied berry aromas lack crispness.

Grassy aromas of apple juice are jumbled and slightly pickled. This stays unfocused on a fizzy palate, while sweet soda-like flavors of lemon-lime and lychee finish sudsy and candied.\n76533\tSpain\tTitiana Brut Pansa Blanca\t87\t25\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParxet 2011 Titiana Brut Pansa Blanca Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tParxet\tLT_90_Points\tThis brut Cava is made entirely from the Xarello grape. It's bready, leesy and yeasty on the nose, with touches of apple and nectarine. A low-verve palate tastes briny, with a hint of lime. On the finish, this tastes like the dust of vitamins.\n49139\tSpain\t\t84\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2009 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tJammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors. Has richness and body but the flavors and congruety are sketchy until you remember that it costs but $7.\n78952\tSpain\tGR5 Senders\t88\t13\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVins El Cep 2016 GR5 Senders Xarel-lo (Pened??s)\tXarel-lo\tVins El Cep\tLT_90_Points\tApple and pear aromas are clean as a whistle. This is varietal Xarello, a key grape in Cava production. It is citrusy and minerally in feel, with lemon, tangerine and stony flavors mixed with a touch of yeast. A tight, exact finish is juicy and stony.\n49556\tSpain\tAnada\t91\t21\tAndalucia\tMontilla-Moriles\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlvear 2005 Anada Pedro Xim??nez (Montilla-Moriles)\tPedro Xim??nez\tAlvear\tGT_90_Points\tClassic aromas of cinnamon, raisin, prune and spice rise from the glass, while flavors of pure caramel, baked apple, chocolate and cinnamon take over. This is thick stuff, but with game acidity it stops short of being syrupy. And it's forever long on the finish. Sweet, rich and balanced. What P.X. ought to be.\n67898\tSpain\t\t88\t112\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tL'Arbossar 2004 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tL'Arbossar\tLT_90_Points\tVery nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.\n5886\tSpain\t\t88\t23\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGotas de Mar 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tGotas de Mar\tLT_90_Points\tThe integrated nose with peach, melon and stony aromas is clean and vital. This weighs in on the full, round and heavy side, while flavors of orange and grapefruit are good but monotone. A briny citrusy finish closes this out. Drink now.\n95642\tSpain\tHito\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCepa 21 2013 Hito  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tCepa 21\tLT_90_Points\tBerry and plum scents are clean, not rubbery. A grabby palate feels right, while flavors of plum and raspberry are basic. Loamy notes rise up on a fairly smooth finish that's devoid of overly hard tannins and shrill acidity.\n110649\tSpain\t\t88\t27\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Coronado 2006 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tFinca Coronado\tLT_90_Points\tThis five-grape blend is dark and concentrated, but also a touch soupy and mulchy. Interestingly, the palate shows snappy acidity along the edges, yielding crisp flavors of cherry, raspberry and spice. Finishes dry, herbal and spicy, but needs a boost of fruit to equal previous efforts.\n2508\tSpain\tVi?ña El Pison\t95\t300\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2011 Vi?ña El Pison  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tArtadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.\n125090\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t29\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVallobera 2015 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVallobera\tLT_90_Points\tSavory oak aromas and related spice notes blend with earthy berry scents.

It feels fresh and zesty, with a medium body and red fruit flavors that are spicy, lightly herbal and generic. A mid-level wine in every way.\n63582\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOstatu 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tOstatu\tLT_90_Points\tThis is so toasty and heavily oaked that it smells burnt and acrid.

The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak.\n37290\tSpain\tBentus\t91\t58\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s del Puerto 2014 Bentus  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s del Puerto\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine's ripe berry aromas are accompanied by creamy oak, pepper and licorice notes.

Its citrus and green herb notes are fresh and prickly while its melon and thyme flavors lose intensity on the slightly bitter finish.\n113914\tSpain\tMalvasia-Verdejo\t81\t12\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Salamanca 2008 Malvasia-Verdejo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tWhite Blend\tVi?ña Salamanca\tLT_90_Points\tDilute and pickled, with similarly pickled citrus and melon flavors that lose direction along the way. Rather weak and mealy wine, with a strange profile that has to be due to the Malvasia/Viura marriage.\n114690\tSpain\tMIM Natura Brut Reserva\t88\t20\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Gelida 2011 MIM Natura Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarqu??s de Gelida\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty, briny scents define the nose on this smooth, round-bodied Cava.

This feels soft and unfocused, with low acidity and a mild bead. Green flavors of lettuce and herbs are more salad-like than fruity, while the finish is soft and lacking in edge.\n42113\tSpain\t\t83\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLarchago 2016 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tLarchago\tLT_90_Points\tDilute melony aromas are slightly spoiled.

Lemony acidity provides lift to the palate, which has a raw, abrasive, tannic bite. Flavors of toast, chocolate, lemon rind and black fruits finish similarly, with a chewy texture. Drink through 2018.\n101008\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tStalky berry aromas lack overt ripeness and pop.

This feels juicy, with orange, tangerine and nectarine flavors. The finish is spunky and acidic but not overly deep or complex. This is 95% Viura and 5% Malvasia.\n79470\tSpain\tCune Rosado\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2012 Cune Rosado Ros??

On the palate, it's resiny and sticky, with overwrought clove and barrel spice flavors that dominate the finish.\n1848\tSpain\tEdicion Limitada\t83\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tGarnacha\tMaximo\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.\n101061\tSpain\tBeautiful Things\t89\t55\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaco Garcia 2008 Beautiful Things  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPaco Garcia\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015.\n121311\tSpain\tVi?ña Borgia\t87\t7\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2011 Vi?ña Borgia Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tYou won't find many $7 wines better than this Garnacha. The bouquet of fresh berries is like a bowl of black fruit. The palate is lively and a touch creamy, with medicinal, candied flavors of plum and cherry. This wine, like most Borsao reds, delivers above its price point.\n19447\tSpain\tCare Crianza\t85\t20\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas A?ñadas 2006 Care Crianza Tempranillo-Merlot (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo-Merlot\tBodegas A?ñadas\tLT_90_Points\tA little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves.

Lightly salty stone-fruit flavors are pushed by bright acidity, which is about all that remains on a racy but mostly tasteless finish.\n50972\tSpain\tSangre de Toro de Casta\t85\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2011 Sangre de Toro de Casta Ros?? (Catalunya)\tRos??\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tThis has berry fruit aromas that don't fully register as crisp and spunky. It feels narrow and tastes tart and tangy, with red plum and cherry pie flavors.

In the mouth, this feels alert, bright and grabby, with a full load of muscular tannins and acidity. Flavors of spiced blackberry, coffee and chocolate are toasty and a touch burnt in character on the finish. Drink through 2023.\n114849\tSpain\tMas de Masos\t91\t70\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCapafons-Oss?? 2003 Mas de Masos Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCapafons-Oss??\tGT_90_Points\tBig, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.\n100312\tSpain\tPedra de Guix\t91\t90\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerroir Al L??mit 2014 Pedra de Guix White (Priorat)\tWhite Blend\tTerroir Al L??mit\tGT_90_Points\tDespite a tan-meets-orange color, this Priorat white is fresh on the nose with apricot aromas. A solid texture with grip controls the palate, while dry white-fruit and orange-peel flavors end with slightly rubbery white-grape tannins.\n36231\tSpain\tBugader\t92\t80\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJoan D'Anguera 2012 Bugader Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tJoan D'Anguera\tGT_90_Points\tStocky plum and smashed-berry aromas offer notes of garrigue and wild animal. As for mouthfeel, this Syrah is layered, chewy and pulpy, with power in reserve. Deep berry and cassis flavors are darkened by toast and spice notes, while the finish is long, spicy and only builds in fruit. Drink through 2022.\n121176\tSpain\tGran\t92\t70\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tElias Mora 2004 Gran  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tElias Mora\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker Victoria Benavides has maxed out the ripeness but has avoided any raisin, prune or molasses characteristics, which we like. Her Gran sits heavier on the palate than the 2004 Crianza, with firm tannins. But it also lingers more solidly on the back of the palate. To admire its purity and power, it's probably best to drink over the next four years.\n82265\tSpain\tPie Franco\t92\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBlanco Nieva 2015 Pie Franco Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBlanco Nieva\tGT_90_Points\tThis old-vines beauty from one of Rueda's top producers offers pure and inviting aromas of fresh apple, citrus and mineral.

It's 15% ABV but balanced, with roasted berry, leather, toasty oak, graphite and prune aromas. The palate feels full, flush and without gaps, while flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and spice finish exceedingly smooth, with loamy notes and leftover spice.

It feels a little blowsy, but there's ample acidic cut to frame the dry, flavors of melon, green banana and apple. This has a simple finish. A blend of 80% Xarello and 20% Riesling.\n25159\tSpain\t\t88\t28\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tElias Mora 2011  Toro\tTinta de Toro\tElias Mora\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a lot of funk and animal hide on the nose of this earthy Toro. The palate is so concentrated it's like syrup, while flavors of leafy, earthy berry fruits are accented by chocolate and pepper. This finishes toasty, oaky and spicy, but also heavy and sticky.\n54561\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t88\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Cerrada 2006 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ña Cerrada\tLT_90_Points\tThis is light and rusty in colorƒ??evidence of a mature wine that's ready to drink now.

Given the nose, it's no surprise that this is syrupy and rich in feel, although fine acidity creates impeccable balance. Flavors of caramel, toffee, salt, raisin and fig finish long, rich and chocolaty.\n120107\tSpain\tLlanos del Almendro\t94\t130\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2012 Llanos del Almendro  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\tMassive blackberry, vanilla and marshmallow aromas are voluptuous. A just-right mix of lushness and tannins determines the palate, which hosts toasty flavors of chocolate and blackberry. A smooth finish with firm but manageable residual tannins is intense but not rough. Drink through 2028.\n12861\tSpain\tAltos de Luz??n\t91\t19\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luz??n 2006 Altos de Luz??n Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Luz??n\tGT_90_Points\tA leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luz??n. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further. Dynamite in terms of ripeness, with monster black-fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Not for the weak.\n84018\tSpain\t\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2014 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tThis barrel-fermented Viura is crystalline on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas, minerally apple notes and a touch of yeast. Balanced and properly acidic, this tastes like nectarine, lemon and persimmon, while the finish is balanced, zesty and a touch oily in texture.\n35346\tSpain\tVi?ña Real Gran Reserva\t92\t44\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2010 Vi?ña Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCVNE\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a young but excellent gran reserva, so it's gritty-smelling in its youth, with aromas of blackberry and cassis. Racy acidity pushes the focus on the palate towards the upper tier, while flavors of lactic oak, lemon peel, tobacco and mocha share the stage with plum and berry fruit. Finishing flavors of vanilla and raw oak are supported by good acidity and just enough pulp. Drink through 2030.\n9960\tSpain\t\t87\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParamus 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tParamus\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy mango and lime aromas are fleshy, but attractive.

A grabby, extracted but balanced and impressive palate holds flavors of coffee, toasty oak, bitter chocolate and wild berries. The finish tastes savory and fully oaked, but not overdone. Hold a few years, then drink through 2026.\n65300\tSpain\tMasdeu\t88\t125\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tScala Dei 2011 Masdeu Garnacha (Priorat)\tGarnacha\tScala Dei\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and plum aromas are lean and citrusy, while the palate on this high-reaching Garnacha is loud and raw, with punishing tannins. Plum skin, cherry and oaky coconut flavors finish with heat and aggression. This is not easy to drink at this point; give it until 2016ƒ??2017 and revisit.\n18129\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, toasty and dark on the nose, this value-priced Rioja delivers plenty for the money. On the palate, it is smooth and ripe, with integrated tannins and proper acidity. Flavors of earth, loamy berry, plum and vanilla are supple and medium in intensity.\n84613\tSpain\tMas La Plana 40th Vintage\t93\t70\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2010 Mas La Plana 40th Vintage Cabernet Sauvignon (Pened??s)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTorres\tGT_90_Points\tSpain's preeminent varietal Cabernet is excellent in its 40th rendition. This single-vineyard wine opens with dark, brooding aromas of rooty spice, licorice, tar, herbs, cassis and prune. In the mouth, this is wiry and tight at the core, but friendly around the edges. Flavors of currant, toast, vanilla, pepper and barbecue sauce finish with ripping acidity but also cuddly, creamy weight. Drink from 2017 through 2030.\n3302\tSpain\tBrut Ros??\t87\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorn??u NV Brut Ros?? Pinot Noir (Cava)\tPinot Noir\tCodorn??u\tLT_90_Points\tThis one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.\n112969\tSpain\t234\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnate 2016 234 Chardonnay (Somontano)\tChardonnay\tEnate\tLT_90_Points\tThis mild, plump and basic Chardonnay leads with peach blossom, yeast and cured ham scents. Its melon, peach and apricot flavors hollow out on a mild, yeasty tasting finish.\n56997\tSpain\t\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondesa Eylo 2008 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tCondesa Eylo\tLT_90_Points\tImmediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.\n12342\tSpain\tFuente Milano\t88\t11\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPedro Escudero 2013 Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tVerdejo-Viura\tPedro Escudero\tLT_90_Points\tWith minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be.\n64666\tSpain\tGarnacha Cabernet\t83\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2010 Garnacha Cabernet Ros?? (Campo de Borja)\tRos??\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tA full-out charge of vanilla aromas is strange for a ros??, but that's what you get along with cherry candy notes. The palate is full and chunky, with stalky berry fruit flavors. Acidity is the wine's saving grace; it keeps things moving.\n70059\tSpain\tFlavus\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Sastre 2013 Flavus Jaen (Ribera del Duero)\tJaen\tVi?ña Sastre\tLT_90_Points\tBriny tropical fruit and minerally aromas are most prominent on this white wine made from Jaen, a.k.a. Menc??a. The palate has a leesy quality to it, but overall this feels standard, with mild melon and vanilla flavors.\n62571\tSpain\tBrut Nature\t88\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet 2004 Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tCrisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey. The palate is crystal clear in its delivery of lemon, apple and green banana, while the finish is vivacious and runs the distance. Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.\n11680\tSpain\t\t87\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDon Olegario 2014 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tDon Olegario\tLT_90_Points\tMild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.\n8452\tSpain\t\t92\t24\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Gebrat 2010 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tClos Gebrat\tGT_90_Points\tFresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking.\n42903\tSpain\tCondesa de Sarabella\t81\t6\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodega Virgen de la Sierra 2007 Condesa de Sarabella Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tBodega Virgen de la Sierra\tLT_90_Points\tGreen and lean Garnacha, with tobacco, celery and other vegetal aromas. Chunky in the mouth, but rather sour tasting, with grassy, green fruit and bite. Not a prime-time player.\n97818\tSpain\t\t84\t\tNorthern Spain\tCigales\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal de Los Frailes 2010 Rosado (Cigales)\tRosado\tVal de Los Frailes\tLT_90_Points\tSmells grassy and sweaty, kind of like Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is chunky and awkward feeling, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. Fades fast and easy on the finish. Contains 20% Verdejo in addition to Tempranillo, which explains the citrusy aromas and flavors. Imported by USA Wine West.\n90630\tSpain\tGetaria\t83\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTxom??n Etxan??z 2011 Getaria Ros?? (Getariako Txakolina)\tRos??\tTxom??n Etxan??z\tLT_90_Points\tWith almost no color, this spritzy rosado is prickly and feline on the nose, like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. The palate is lightly bubbly, with bounce and tart tangerine and herbal flavors. Txomin Etxan??z has never made a commercial ros?? prior to this. This makes you wonder why they did.\n9089\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t57\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de Carraovejas 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de Carraovejas\tLT_90_Points\tBig, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.\n79908\tSpain\tBanda Roja Reserva Red\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFederico Paternina 2006 Banda Roja Reserva Red  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFederico Paternina\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells rubbery and gritty, with notes of gas and leather. It feels acidic and drawing but healthy, with earthy red-berry flavors. Dry and peppy, there's still not a lot of style or character to the wine.\n101291\tSpain\t\t83\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFillaboa 2013 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tFillaboa\tLT_90_Points\tMature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albari?ño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.\n69815\tSpain\tZarautz\t83\t24\tNorthern Spain\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTxakoli Primo 2016 Zarautz Ros??\tRos??\tTxakoli Primo\tLT_90_Points\tA crisp nose is trimmed with light citrus and chewing gum notes.

A fleshy nose of peach and almond aromas sets up a simple, lighter-weight palate with peach flavors and an easygoing finish. This is short on acidity so drink sooner rather than later.\n21748\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLogos 2012 Rosado (Navarra)\tRosado\tLogos\tLT_90_Points\tThis barrel-fermented ros?? lives with the devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other. It's woody and smells and tastes like sawdust. Amid all the barrel influence, there's a round, smooth mouthfeel and food-friendly acidity. The finish turns more resiny and creamy the longer it lingers.\n88641\tSpain\tHacienda Pradalagar\t88\t140\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Vargas 2005 Hacienda Pradalagar  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqu??s de Vargas\tLT_90_Points\tLeafy, earthy aromas of raisin, baked plum and leather are oaky but also a touch green. High acidity creates an upright, juicy mouthfeel, while shrill, acid-driven flavors of plum and berry fruits end with a green reprise as well as flavors of tobacco and citrus peel. This will last a long, long time; drink through 2030.\n40997\tSpain\tConde de Alicante Selecci??n\t86\t9\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2014 Conde de Alicante Selecci??n Tempranillo (Alicante)\tTempranillo\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and raspberry aromas are modest on the nose.

Fairly light in weight, but juicy and fresh, with cleansing acidity and some sharpness.\n50471\tSpain\tVinya La Scala Gran Reserva\t86\t55\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago Jean Leon 1999 Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Pened??s)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tPago Jean Leon\tLT_90_Points\tA holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.\n32915\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t42\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCostaval 2004 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tCostaval\tLT_90_Points\tSupremely dense, with plum and berry jam, charred beef and molasses on the nose. The flavors go straight to blackberry, vanilla and chocolate, while the feel is full-bodied and probably a touch more tannic than desirable. Flush and even more tannic on the finish. Needs food and/or time in the cellar.\n73790\tSpain\tSierras de M?­laga Blanco\t87\t25\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2011 Sierras de M?­laga Blanco White (M?­laga)\tWhite Blend\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tRubber band, almond skin and dry citrus aromas feed into a tight, raw, rubbery feeling palate with a low fruit quotient and more brine and bitterness than expected. This is quite dry, salty and pithy but also fresh and lively on the finish. Drink immediately.\n33743\tSpain\t\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNebla 2012 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNebla\tLT_90_Points\tThis basic Verdejo from Rueda offers minerally apple and citrus aromas in front of a zesty, citric palate. Flavors of orange and nectarine are nice but entirely regular, while the finish is crisp and chalky.\n9104\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVaza 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVaza\tLT_90_Points\tFrom Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.\n22017\tSpain\tPuerta Vieja Crianza Selecci??n\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2014 Puerta Vieja Crianza Selecci??n  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine's creamy, woody maple and tobacco aromas are within Rioja norms.

The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albari?ño.\n90260\tSpain\t\t86\t8\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaximo 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tMaximo\tLT_90_Points\tBerry fruit and mild leather open this good little bargain. There's adequate body and fullness, some oak, and then bright, fresh berry, herb and spice flavors. Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.\n17055\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tCentral Spain\tValdepe?ñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLaguna de la Nava 2013 Verdejo (Valdepe?ñas)\tVerdejo\tLaguna de la Nava\tLT_90_Points\tThis Verdejo is past its prime. A leesy, chunky mouthfeel backs up basic aromas of orange peel, lemon and apple.

It's a bit darker and more tan in color than what you'd expect, with fine acidity and integration throughout. Shows touches of white pepper, nutmeg and dried papaya on a classy finish. Dry and subtle at all points.\n79243\tSpain\t\t87\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2013 Ros??

Drink now.\n106929\tSpain\tRoble\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPr??ncipe de Viana 2015 Roble Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tPr??ncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tThis standard Garnacha feels jammy but a bit shapeless.

The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.\n37067\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.\n39995\tSpain\tRosado\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2007 Rosado Ros?? (Campo de Borja)\tRos??\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tRed in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.\n18378\tSpain\tTempranillo-Garnacha-Mazuelo\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron de Escal 2013 Tempranillo-Garnacha-Mazuelo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBaron de Escal\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, earthy berry aromas carry a minerally accent. This feels balanced and medium in weight, with a mix of red-berry fruits making up the flavor profile. The finish loses some brightness and snap while transitioning to loamy and earthy.\n129178\tSpain\tLobetia\t85\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Punctum 2016 Lobetia Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tDominio de Punctum\tLT_90_Points\tGrapy aromas of black cherry are young and fruity but unsophisticated. This everyday Tempranillo is more superficial than deep in build. Sweet as well as peppery black-fruit flavors finish mild.\n44836\tSpain\t\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRavent??s de Alella 2015 Pansa Blanca (Alella)\tPansa Blanca\tRavent??s de Alella\tLT_90_Points\tDusty applesauce aromas lead to a pulpy, medium-bodied palate in this pure Xarello.

There's also ample spice, chocolate and toast to give it a dark personality. Nice for a young wine; it's flush, lush and quite dense.\n111197\tSpain\t\t84\t5\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbrazo 2001 Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tAbrazo\tLT_90_Points\tFull and minty, and quite the bargain at five bucks. This bargain buster features some cherry liqueur and sucking-candy flavors, while the finish is not devoid of some class, as it offers coffee and chocolate notes. Yes, it's a bit like cherry soda without the bubbles, but what's not to like at this price, especially if the menu calls for burgers or London broil? If Two Buck Chuck is so popular, try giving this wine ƒ??hug,ƒ?� the English translation for abrazo. Best Buy.\n123611\tSpain\tAlfar Vendimia Seleccionada\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValdelacierva 2012 Alfar Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tValdelacierva\tLT_90_Points\tCedary oak aromas are draped heavily over this smoky, dark, cheesy-smelling Rioja. The mouthfeel is tight, tannic and resiny, but also spunky and properly acidic. Raw oak, coconut and vanilla accent dark-berry core flavors, while the finish is much like the bouquet: toasty and woody.\n4555\tSpain\tRam??n Roqueta\t81\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas 1898 2009 Ram??n Roqueta Garnacha (Catalunya)\tGarnacha\tBodegas 1898\tLT_90_Points\tThis reedy, strained Garnacha features cheesy aromas, stalky fruit and chemical notes.

There's a fair amount of astringency to the palate, while flavors of plum and red berries finish juicy but also briny and a touch horsey in flavor.\n108105\tSpain\tAndi??n\t86\t16\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas N?§?ñez 2014 Andi??n Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tBodegas N?§?ñez\tLT_90_Points\tRound, creamy apple aromas open things up. This is melony and soft in feel, with flavors of cider, lemon and lychee. A tropical-leaning finish is solid but suggestive of a wine in decline.

The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.\n45562\tSpain\t\t82\t12\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEquilibrio 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tEquilibrio\tLT_90_Points\tThis Monastrell-Syrah blend feels grabby and tight, while the flavor profile goes in the direction of weedy and resiny.

That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity.

Good wine for $8.\n3237\tSpain\tTreyu\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empord?ÿ)\tWhite Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.\n29148\tSpain\tVictoria 2\t92\t26\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co. 2008 Victoria 2 Moscatel (M?­laga)\tMoscatel\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co.\tGT_90_Points\tThis opens with pure, attractive nectarine and apricot aromas, along with hints of mineral and petrol.

This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe. Drink through 2017.\n80145\tSpain\tBarrica\t88\t16\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMonterebro 2014 Barrica Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tMonterebro\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly rustic earthy aromas of animal, blackberry, plum and cola feed into a jammy palate with just enough acidic pop. Chocolaty blackberry flavors are touched up by resiny oak, while this blend of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah tastes similar on a persistent finish.\n24679\tSpain\t\t85\t6\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Borgia 2008 Grenache (Campo de Borja)\tGrenache\tVi?ña Borgia\tLT_90_Points\tFloral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.\n11430\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial\t91\t60\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVizar 2009 Selecci??n Especial Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tRed Blend\tVizar\tGT_90_Points\tOaky, inky aromas of blackberry and vanilla are pushy and potent. This blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Syrah is rubbery and pinched on the palate, while toasty, rooty flavors of black fruits blend with herbal berry and coffee notes. A narrow finish is herbal in flavor and weighty. Drink through 2020.\n54377\tSpain\tDido\t88\t30\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Universal 2009 Dido Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tLa Universal\tLT_90_Points\tGritty aromas of olive, herbs and charred berry give this Montsant wine a Chilean-like bouquet. The palate is wide, blunt and tannic, with blackberry and stewed plum flavors. It mellows out on the finish, with earth notes. It's solid and sturdy, but feels tough. A blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n123430\tSpain\tRosado Garnacha\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2011 Rosado Garnacha Ros??

Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.\n114091\tSpain\tMonasterio de Palazuelos\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDe Alberto 2014 Monasterio de Palazuelos Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tDe Alberto\tLT_90_Points\tThis feels good in a regular sense, with apple-driven acidity and leesy notes of vanilla. A standard, zesty, pithy palate offers briny, slightly bitter flavors of peach and pulpy citrus, while the finish feels citric and tastes briny.\n102370\tSpain\t\t87\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda)\tSauvignon Blanc\tEmina\tLT_90_Points\tRound, chunky aromas of grapefruit and passion fruit settle on friendly and varietally correct. This is snappy and solid in feel, with lime, orange and nectarine flavors. An acid-driven finish holds the line and doesn't taste bitter or green.\n107569\tSpain\tMontgarnatx\t88\t45\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFrancesc Sanchez Bas 2004 Montgarnatx Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFrancesc Sanchez Bas\tLT_90_Points\tA little rusty in color and somewhat transparent, with raisin as the key aroma. There's not a lot going on in the mouth, but the wine is mellow and deep, with sweet flavors of molasses, berry syrup and baked black fruits. Rich and candied, but rather sweet and a touch dull for Priorat. Drink now.\n33340\tSpain\tZios de Lusco\t84\t19\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLusco 2008 Zios de Lusco Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tLusco\tLT_90_Points\tHarder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.\n27292\tSpain\tCala N. 1\t88\t15\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTinedo 2009 Cala N. 1 Tempranillo-Shiraz (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo-Shiraz\tTinedo\tLT_90_Points\tWiry, scratchy raspberry aromas are a touch herbal but stop short of veering toward green. This blend is full, rubbery and a touch sticky in feel. Flavors of blackberry, oak and mint finish with heavy tannins and a resiny, grabby feel.\n120641\tSpain\tThalarn\t90\t55\tCatalonia\tCosters del Segre\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastell d'Encus 2014 Thalarn Syrah (Costers del Segre)\tSyrah\tCastell d'Encus\tGT_90_Points\tAn unusual opening of cookie dough and black-fruit aromas suggests a ripe wine, and this is definitely on the full side. While the palate is chunky and lacks a distinct focal point, flavors of tomato, herbs and baked plum are complex and meaty. A leathery feel along with herbal plum flavors defines the finish.\n41370\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLas Colinas Del Ebro 2015 Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)\tGarnacha Blanca\tLas Colinas Del Ebro\tLT_90_Points\tOn the surface, this smells of green apple and citrus, although deeper digging reveals pickled briny scents. A pinched citric palate and dry bitter flavors of green fruits and almond skins finish mild and slightly bitter.\n128227\tSpain\tTarima\t87\t9\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2016 Tarima Rosado (Alicante)\tRosado\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tThis light-colored, alert wine with melon and nectarine aromas is confident up front.

Crisp flavors of pie cherry, currant and rose water finish fresh.\n102137\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBurgo Viejo 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBurgo Viejo\tGT_90_Points\tBerry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise.\n119915\tSpain\tLoidana\t90\t30\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2010 Loidana Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMarco Abella\tGT_90_Points\tRipe but nuanced aromas of tobacco, fig, berry and cassis come in front of a crisp, lively, fresh palate.

For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose. It's smooth, sweet and easygoing, and overall it's just elegant and lively enough to jostle your palate.\n83309\tSpain\t12 Crianza\t92\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarc??a Figuero 2012 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarc??a Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tRock-solid aromas of toasty oak, black fruits and leather are textbook for Ribera del Duero. This is structurally sound, with deep earthy blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors that announce quality wood work. A long warm toasty finish means this ends as well as it opens. Drink through 2020.\n71320\tSpain\tVS Reserva\t91\t100\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal Sotillo 2004 VS Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tRed Blend\tVal Sotillo\tGT_90_Points\tFull, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings.

A full palate with an iron grip shows flavors of black fruits and coffee. A fleshy finish is spicy and dark in flavor.

Woody, spicy flavors of clove, pepper, chocolate and plum finish similarly, meaning this superb blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is still in a youthful phase.

A big, bulky palate is round but offers enough acidic kick to keep everything above water. Baked, flat flavors of black fruits and roasted meat finish smooth but low on pulse.

Simple but fresh apple and apricot aromas are clean, while the palate is high in acidity, which is typical for the region.

In the mouth, this is pushed by fresh acidity and weighty berry fruit. Peppery flavors of black plum, blackberry and spice show outsize oak on the finish. Drink through 2024 with the understanding that as each year passes this will taste less oaky and more integrated.\n102263\tSpain\tEstate Grown Selecci??n Especial\t93\t28\tNorthern Spain\tSardon de Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadia Retuerta 2012 Estate Grown Selecci??n Especial Red (Sardon de Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tAbadia Retuerta\tGT_90_Points\tFew wines offer as much as this for under $30, but this extracted, bullish Tempranillo blend is not for everyone. Blackberry, cola and savory herbal aromas are strong and pure. This feels wide and cushioned, yet is still a driller. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors finish rich and ripe.

With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.\n98048\tSpain\tTarima Hill Estate Bottled Old Vines\t87\t17\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2011 Tarima Hill Estate Bottled Old Vines Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tThis Monastrell is dark, youthful, concentrated and robust on the nose.

It's an intense blend with aromas of blackberry, pepper, toasted oak and smokiness. A deep, pure palate pumps out cherry, plum and especially cassis flavors, while baking-spice notes come prior to clove, toast and char on the finish.

A round feeling finish offers up minerality and length.\n110130\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Arviza 2001 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s de Arviza\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity. In the mouth, vanilla and spice add character to common berry fruit flavors, while the finish is silky and fairly long. Overall this is a nice, handsome wine with balance and character. Expect to be pleased but not blown away.\n84524\tSpain\t\t88\t20\tCentral Spain\tSierra de Salamanca\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Zorra 2014 Red (Sierra de Salamanca)\tRed Blend\tLa Zorra\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and berry aromas are tight and focused, with no indication of oak. A blend of Tempranillo and Rufete, this wine is snappy and drawing in feel.

This feels healthy and standard, with full-force flavors of medicinal berry. It's tight, fresh and slightly resiny on the finish, despite having spent only three months in oak. A blend of 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan.\n36490\tSpain\tAurus\t94\t248\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Allende 2005 Aurus  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca Allende\tGT_90_Points\tWith the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.\n48358\tSpain\tVi?ña Main Tinto Joven\t82\t12\tCentral Spain\tVinos de Madrid\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Orusco 2009 Vi?ña Main Tinto Joven Tempranillo-Shiraz (Vinos de Madrid)\tTempranillo-Shiraz\tBodegas Orusco\tLT_90_Points\tA sappy, heavy Spanish red with candied aromas that fall off to raisin and grass.

Thereƒ??s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; itƒ??s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy. Roquefort notes indicate that there may be some bacteriological problems.\n73647\tSpain\tReal de Arag??n Centenaria\t89\t26\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos Familia Langa 2011 Real de Arag??n Centenaria Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tPagos Familia Langa\tLT_90_Points\tFlush, jammy, spicy, peppery aromas are good and fruity. This is full and tight on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of plum, berry, vanilla and wood resin finish with a pinched, rubbery feel. This needs food in order to soften the texture.\n89660\tSpain\tJoven\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Altava 2015 Joven Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tConde de Altava\tLT_90_Points\tBriny pickled aromas are just clean enough to pass muster. This simple Viura is lemony and tangy on the palate, with saline-influenced flavors of citrus fruits and bell pepper.

In the mouth, this has textural issues, namely it's abrupt and tannic. Flavors of mild chocolate, carob and blueberry are uncommon for Ribera del Duero.\n94570\tSpain\tCristalino Brut\t85\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJaume Serra NV Cristalino Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJaume Serra\tLT_90_Points\tA little cidery and funky smelling at first, but it settles to show stalky notes, scallion, tarragon and citrus flavors.

It's bready, leesy and yeasty on the nose, with touches of apple and nectarine. A low-verve palate tastes briny, with a hint of lime. On the finish, this tastes like the dust of vitamins.\n118149\tSpain\tWine Wings Moscatel-Garnacha\t83\t20\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIgnacio Mar??n 2015 Wine Wings Moscatel-Garnacha White (Cari?ñena)\tWhite Blend\tIgnacio Mar??n\tLT_90_Points\tTropical aromas of lychee are about all that stand out on the nose of this unusual Moscatel-Garnacha Blanca blend. Neither dry nor sweet, this seems caught in no man's land. A dilute mouthfeel and bitter pyrazine notes on the finish don't help this along.\n125851\tSpain\tAlma de Vino\t93\t39\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontebaco 2011 Alma de Vino  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMontebaco\tGT_90_Points\tBlackberry, a hint of raisin, mild char and lemon-peel aromas make for a fine bouquet. This is lively, punchy and chewy, with big tannins. Blackberry, chocolate, loamy earth, toast and peppery flavors finish long, baked, ripe and with the potential for an even better future. Drink through 2021.\n91879\tSpain\tCordon Negro Extra Dry\t85\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tStandard apple aromas come with hints of sulfur.

In the mouth, this blend of Viura and Malvasia is full-bodied and braced by sharp acidity. Flavors of walnut, baked peach and citrus peel finish with nutty notes and angular acidity. At six years of age, this is showing some gaps in its fiber.\n75465\tSpain\tBarrica\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMart??n Berdugo 2009 Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMart??n Berdugo\tLT_90_Points\tClean and penetrating on the nose, with leather and warm berry/cherry aromas. Comes across bright and lively, with good balance and an appealing, easygoing set of wild berry and spice flavors. Shows length and follow-through on the finish. Very good for affordable RDD.\n119899\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLinaje Garsea 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLinaje Garsea\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.\n17679\tSpain\t\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tScala Dei 2013 Garnacha (Priorat)\tGarnacha\tScala Dei\tLT_90_Points\tTransparent in color, with a nose that is equally light and airy, this is a crisp, dry, slightly oaky wine, with a hard-smacking palate. Red plum, raspberry, strawberry and currant flavors are subdued, and lead to a sweet-and-sour finish.\n76327\tSpain\tReserva\t84\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2002 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tFiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.\n115442\tSpain\tOrganic\t87\t11\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSpartico 2016 Organic Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tSpartico\tLT_90_Points\tGranulated berry and plum aromas are slightly reduced and come with an animal note on this Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A flush, weighty palate is well balanced, while flavors of dark plum and cassis finish tannic and a bit rubbery.\n113476\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Cerrada 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ña Cerrada\tLT_90_Points\tBasic plum, raspberry and leather aromas are good but not fancy or special. This is narrow and punchy on the palate, with hard tannins and pointy acidity. Roasted red-fruit flavors come with a woody accent, while the finish is oaky, dry and short on flavor. Drink now.\n91248\tSpain\t\t85\t21\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuna Beberide 2014 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tLuna Beberide\tLT_90_Points\tShy honeyed aromas of tropical fruits wind up at banana. This feels fleshy and not direct, while soft powdery flavors of leesy melon and papaya finish with notes of oxidation, as if this is already starting to fade.\n49281\tSpain\tDel Duque Amontillado Viejo 375 ml\t92\t49\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonz?­lez Byass NV Del Duque Amontillado Viejo 375 ml Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tGonz?­lez Byass\tGT_90_Points\tRich, nutty and serious, with focus and power along with depth. This is a weighty, full-force style of amontillado that tips the scale at 21.5%, which is high. But for heady Sherry, this is excellent stuff. Toasted pecan, layered viscosity, balancing acids and pecan, walnut and almond flavors make for an intensely smooth ride.\n11453\tSpain\tTermes\t91\t20\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNumanthia 2011 Termes  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNumanthia\tGT_90_Points\tTermes always delivers a full taste of Toro at an affordable price.

Fournier\tLT_90_Points\tIn general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.\n99028\tSpain\tSelecci??n\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fuentespina 2010 Selecci??n  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Fuentespina\tLT_90_Points\tRarely will you find more hickory and barbecued aromas and flavors than this RDD is showing.

Dry peppery black-fruit flavors finish with toasty oak and licorice notes. Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.\n680\tSpain\tSelecci??n Crianza\t90\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Berceo 2011 Selecci??n Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Berceo\tGT_90_Points\tPlum, prune and raspberry aromas are solid.

The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.\n125823\tSpain\tTempranillo\t80\t9\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPe?ñascal 2011 Tempranillo Ros??

It begins with dry, leafy and vanilla aromas along with cherry and raspberry. The palate is fairly acidic, but food will tame any wayward sharpness.

The mouthfeel is grating, with sandpaper tannins. Odd, herbal, citrusy notes infiltrate core blueberry flavors, while the finish is hard as nails and tannic to an extreme. Only 200 cases made.\n45826\tSpain\tBlanco\t84\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLoess 2010 Blanco Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tLoess\tLT_90_Points\tThe bouquet is dry, briney and otherwise neutral.

And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.\n1764\tSpain\tBrut Rose\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBiutiful NV Brut Rose Garnacha (Cava)\tGarnacha\tBiutiful\tLT_90_Points\tPickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest.

Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011.\n99656\tSpain\tCosme Palacio 1894 Tinto\t88\t60\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2008 Cosme Palacio 1894 Tinto  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tGenerally 88-pointers don't call for cellaring, but this one could gain style points with time in the bottle. Now it's dark and promising, with berry, cherry, earth and tobacco. It's also hard but manageable, with lightly herbal blackberry, cherry and brown sugar flavors. Finishes dark and toasty.\n81693\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t29\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVallobera 2015 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVallobera\tLT_90_Points\tSavory oak aromas and related spice notes blend with earthy berry scents.

It's a fresh yet oaky type of Rioja, with resiny creaminess cut by lively acidity. Flavors of vanilla, plum, raspberry and tobacco are traditional, while the finish is mild, crisp and snappy. Hold until 2014 and drink through 2019.\n93205\tSpain\tNegre\t86\t19\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarb?? 2011 Negre Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tGarb??\tLT_90_Points\tField notes of clover and herbs lend spice and roughness to the bouquet.

Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.\n91212\tSpain\tVi?ña Alarde Crianza\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBerberana 2007 Vi?ña Alarde Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBerberana\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with leather, cowhide and sweet notes of raisin and licorice. The palate is a bit scratchy, with leathery red fruit flavors, oak-driven spice, bitterness and then mild heat on what amounts to a snappy but earthy finish. Improves with airing.\n70488\tSpain\t\t84\t28\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca las Caraballas 2013 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tVerdejo\tFinca las Caraballas\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized aromas of vanilla and butterscotch are not terribly enticing or fresh. This chunky Verdejo is round and peachy, with oxidized, leesy flavors of melon and peach.

With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.\n123443\tSpain\t\t87\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres 2011 Ros??

Quick, round and solid on the finish, which lingers for quite some time. A fine summer sipper.\n69425\tSpain\tZinio\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPatrocinio 2010 Zinio  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPatrocinio\tLT_90_Points\tThis starts out leafy and earthy, but improves with airing. A lively palate delivers herbal plum and berry flavors along with ample spice. The finish is bold and bright initially, transitioning to tight and peppery.\n118606\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t86\t16\tCentral Spain\tValdepe?ñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Albali 2001 Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepe?ñas)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Albali\tLT_90_Points\tA little burnt and chemical up front, and soon after the nose turns to lemon and shoe polish as the oak takes over. Flavors of raspberry, cherry skins and plums have a true but hollow flavor, and for the most part this wine wears its personality on its sleeve. Which means it's good, for Valdepe?ñas but there aren't any hidden nuances.\n45153\tSpain\tRosado\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Vilano 2008 Rosado Tempranillo (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Vilano\tLT_90_Points\tAn improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice ros?? from Tempranillo.\n111722\tSpain\tOld Vines\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNisia 2012 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNisia\tLT_90_Points\tThis Verdejo is fruity and tropical on the bouquet.

Decent feel, maybe a little high in acid, and showing a pithy bitterness on the crisp finish.\n36036\tSpain\tLori?ñon Crianza\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Breton 2008 Lori?ñon Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Breton\tLT_90_Points\tFloral and lightly earthy on the nose, with a touch of latex.

The palate is wide, blunt and tannic, with blackberry and stewed plum flavors. It mellows out on the finish, with earth notes. It's solid and sturdy, but feels tough. A blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n127136\tSpain\tGraciano\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tProelio 2015 Graciano Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tProelio\tLT_90_Points\tThis Graciano-based ros?? smells oily, a bit funky and like chewing gum, with no specific fruit scents. A high-acid palate reflects the high-acid base grape, while this tastes salty, tangy and pickled, with vague fruit flavors that turn briny on the finish.\n125015\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZudugarai 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)\tHondarrabi Zuri\tZudugarai\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors.

This everyday Garnacha is fresh and fruity in feel, with good but standard plum and cherry flavors. An edgy grating finish with a spot of oak character wraps this up.\n21661\tSpain\t\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFra Guerau 2006 Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tFra Guerau\tLT_90_Points\tA big, warm, baked wine made from Merlot, Garnacha, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.

It feels plump, mealy and a touch flat, with nectarine and wheat flavors. Chunky and peachy on the finish, this is starting to fade.\n74401\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLoca 2013 Tempranillo (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo\tLoca\tLT_90_Points\tFloral cherry and raspberry scents are moderately earthy. This has an edgy, tannic feel along with good plum and cherry flavors that don't falter or break up on a choppy, lightly candied-tasting finish.\n19696\tSpain\tAbadal\t88\t13\tCatalonia\tPla de Bages\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMasies d'Avinyo 2004 Abadal Red (Pla de Bages)\tRed Blend\tMasies d'Avinyo\tLT_90_Points\tTempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome. This is yet another well-made, interesting wine from one of our favorite obscure Spanish labels.\n92314\tSpain\tWinemaker's Selection\t84\t6\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection Ros??

Aromas of wild-berry fruits are clumsy and wooly. This feels narrow, raw and choppy, with gritty plum and candied berry flavors that fall off on the finish.\n19805\tSpain\tBrut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia\t83\t17\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuv?? y Camps 2008 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJuv?? y Camps\tLT_90_Points\tNormally I'm a fan of Juv?? y Camps. This bottling is bland on the nose, with a cleaning-solution aroma. The palate is foamy in feel and short in flavor, with a strange blend of bitter lettuce, brine and green herbs. Frankly, it's not up to par, a possible reflection of the below-average 2008 vintage.\n73780\tSpain\t\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRio Madre 2012  Rioja\tGraciano\tRio Madre\tLT_90_Points\tJammy aromas of red berries, red licorice sticks and green herbs filter toward a pinched mouthfeel with creamy oak for an offset. Flavors of boysenberry are dilute but fresh and friendly. Overall, this is good and easy but simple, with gaps in its fiber.\n120859\tSpain\tSa??

Fresh, tight and mildly acidic on the palate, this snappy, tasty red delivers peppery, oaky, slightly medicinal red-berry flavors in front of a composed, spicy finish with modest espresso bitterness.

Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.\n72411\tSpain\tGran Dama de Toro\t84\t45\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fari?ña 2004 Gran Dama de Toro  (Toro)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Fari?ña\tLT_90_Points\tSweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.\n39338\tSpain\tLuz??n Roble\t87\t12\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luz??n 2013 Luz??n Roble Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Luz??n\tLT_90_Points\tThis Monastrell's cherry and cassis aromas show a rough, oaky burn.

A generous wine to drink now through 2015.\n29416\tSpain\tBaron de Filar Reserva\t88\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Pe?ñafiel 2012 Baron de Filar Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Pe?ñafiel\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, woody, spicy berry aromas suggest briar patch and sandalwood. This is quite clampy and tannic, and thus the mouthfeel is rough. Gritty, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with a strong sense of oak and abrasive tannins. Drink through 2021.\n48861\tSpain\t\t83\t8\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRess?ý 2013 Garnacha (Catalunya)\tGarnacha\tRess?ý\tLT_90_Points\tLoamy, earthy aromas of raspberry and raisin fall flat as this breathes. A heavy palate is low on freshness and acidity, while prune, cherry and cassis flavors veer toward raisin on a finish that quickly loses clarity and snap.\n80884\tSpain\tVallobera Crianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSan Pedro 1999 Vallobera Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSan Pedro\tLT_90_Points\tDeep but reticent on the nose, with somewhat muted cherry and blackberry aromas. Plum and black-fruit flavors come prior to a dark, mouth-filling finish that's properly tannic and entirely substantive. For a mid-price Rioja there's depth, and beyond that the flavors and feel are clean and attractive.\n65884\tSpain\tC\t88\t16\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Carchelo 2013 C Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Carchelo\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, rustic, almost nutty aromas are suggestive of the difficult 2013 vintage. On the palate, this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is direct but high in acid. Earthy black-fruit flavors finish quick, with a lasting salty note.\n54829\tSpain\tM2 de Matallana\t85\t39\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2004 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tExpect no shortage of power and pounding tannins from this modern-styled, heavily extracted Tempranillo. The nose is dark, sweet and jammy, but all pleasantries cease there; the palate is tannic as nails, with baked plum and other roasted dark-fruit flavors. To this taster, it's a hard, tough wine. Others may find it more appealing.\n119762\tSpain\tCala N.1\t87\t15\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTinedo 2013 Cala N.1 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo Blend\tTinedo\tLT_90_Points\tDrawn-down aromas of berry fruit and hard spices are narrow. This is hard on the palate, with pounding tannins and dark, almost burnt black-fruit flavors that finish peppery to the point of bitterness. This is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.\n96329\tSpain\tPagos Viejos\t92\t100\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2010 Pagos Viejos  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tIntense but classy aromas of berry fruits, minerality, vanilla and chocolate are milder and richer than the wine's racy, structured, acid-rich palate. Flavors of blackberry come with a shock of bracing tartness, while oaky aftershocks offer up chocolate and woodspice flavors. A zesty, firm, hard-driving finish brings a touch of sharpness. Drink through 2022.\n55954\tSpain\tGran Reserva Tempranillo\t91\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2004 Gran Reserva Tempranillo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tRam??n Bilbao\tGT_90_Points\tHickory is the lead aroma, followed by notes of leather, earthy berry and spice. It feels juicy, lively and traditional, with a fine body-to-acid ratio. This offers classic Rioja flavors of red fruit, tomato, tobacco, dill and vanilla, with a long, consistent finish. It's healthy and drinkable now through 2017.\n53534\tSpain\tAlta R??o Reserva\t89\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConsejo de la Alta 2008 Alta R??o Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tConsejo de la Alta\tLT_90_Points\tOn first take, this smells murky and baked, but with airing it freshens up. In the mouth, this features hard acidity while the flavor profile leans towards prune, earthy plum and toasty oak. There's heat and roughness to the finish along with woodsy, spicy berry flavors. Drink through 2020.\n762\tSpain\tSolo\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOro de Castilla 2010 Solo Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tOro de Castilla\tLT_90_Points\tRound and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.\n763\tSpain\tIpsum\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPablo del Villar 2010 Ipsum Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)\tVerdejo-Viura\tPablo del Villar\tLT_90_Points\tWhite fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.\n107964\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada Reserva\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2005 Vendimia Seleccionada Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSolid up front, with sweet and spicy aromas of plum, vanilla and candied berry. Feels full and good, with weight and thickness boosting up toasty, woody berry flavors. Dries out on the finish, leaving spice and a resiny taste.

Pure concentrated aromas of blackberry, licorice and lemony oak introduce an intense palate with baked blackberry and cassis flavors. A toasty dark spicy finish exhibits notes of coffee and bitter chocolate as it slowly fades away. Drink through 2025.\n51699\tSpain\tNegre\t86\t19\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarb?? 2011 Negre Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tGarb??\tLT_90_Points\tField notes of clover and herbs lend spice and roughness to the bouquet. This is strong on the palate, with herbal-leaning plum and berry flavors. Hard, peppery spice notes ride high on an herbal tasting and juicy feeling finish.\n82038\tSpain\tAurora Amontillado\t88\t18\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Yuste NV Aurora Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tBodegas Yuste\tLT_90_Points\tInitially, this is sharp up the nostrils, and after that it's obtuse and somewhat wayward. Briny salty nutty flavors lead the charge, but beyond that it's hard to find anything elevated or specific in this amontillado that finishes with controlled bitterness.\n11498\tSpain\tSanta Rosa Reserva\t92\t45\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnrique Mendoza 2008 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante)\tRed Blend\tEnrique Mendoza\tGT_90_Points\tThe bouquet on this blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is toasty and elevated, a clear invitation to dig in. In the mouth, the flow is silky smooth and just snappy enough, with finely etched acidity pushing raspberry, plum, herb and cocoa flavors. This is excellent in every way; drink nowƒ??2018.\n52336\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Bujanda 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Bujanda\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.\n64399\tSpain\tDurius Magister\t89\t45\tNorthern Spain\tArribes del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de la Concordia 2007 Durius Magister Tempranillo (Arribes del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMarqu??s de la Concordia\tLT_90_Points\tThe bouquet is dosed with resiny oak and vanilla aromas, but there are herbal notes, leather and red fruit scents as well. It feels good but slightly sticky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut, tomato, red plum and herb. This feels good on the finish, with tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now through 2015.\n45023\tSpain\tValdegatiles\t94\t125\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2011 Valdegatiles  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\tLush prune and raisin aromas stop short of being mushy and make way for fresher notes of black currant and toast. Saturated, dense and chewy on the palate, this tastes ripe and toasty, with hefty blackberry and chocolate flavors. Additional toastiness and peppery spice flavors work the finish on this generous Tempranillo from an excellent vintage. Drink from 2017ƒ??2030.\n20335\tSpain\t\t92\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVetus 2011  Toro\tTinta de Toro\tVetus\tGT_90_Points\tThe nose on this ripe Tinta de Toro is dense, bold and brimming with black-fruit aromas. Following the nose, this tastes of blackberry, cassis and various spices, while finishing black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal, spicy and complex. This offers a touch of everything good, and even more when it comes to ripe fruit. Drink through 2024.\n90423\tSpain\t\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCuatro Pasos 2012 Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tCuatro Pasos\tLT_90_Points\tIt has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.\n7249\tSpain\t12 Meses\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPictor 2009 12 Meses  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tPictor\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells like horseradish and beets at first, but with time it softens up to reveal cleaner black fruit and maple aromas. It feels grabby and gritty, with strong tannic bite and black fruit flavors. It retains a ruggedness on the finish, along with molasses and chocolate flavors.\n68128\tSpain\t\t84\t13\tLevante\tYecla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNabuko 2009 Monastrell-Syrah (Yecla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tNabuko\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted and rubbery on the nose, this has herb and leaf accents. It feels thick, chunky and a bit syrupy, with flavors of herb, mint and roasted blackberry. This turns grittier on the finish, with bacon, hickory and rubbery flavors. A blend of 50% Monastrell and 50% Syrah.\n62678\tSpain\tTe??filo Reyes 16 Meses en Barrica\t85\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Reyes 2009 Te??filo Reyes 16 Meses en Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Reyes\tLT_90_Points\tThis is jumpy on the nose, with raw oak, green notes and zest. Aromas of earth, blueberry and wood don't fully come together, while the palate is acidic and cidery in feel. Slightly underripe flavors of cranberry and blueberry run counter to the vintage, which was warm and generous by RDD standards.\n127861\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBohigas 2013 Xarel-lo (Catalunya)\tXarel-lo\tBohigas\tLT_90_Points\tLime and grapefruit aromas are tight and come with a touch of edgy harshness. The palate shows bright acidity and is clean as a whole. Mixed citrus flavors are straightforward, and so is the finish.\n123126\tSpain\tHache Garnacha-Syrah\t84\t65\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOlvena 2006 Hache Garnacha-Syrah Red (Somontano)\tRed Blend\tOlvena\tLT_90_Points\tRound, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence.\n117906\tSpain\t\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas La Cartuja 2013 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tBodegas La Cartuja\tLT_90_Points\tStalky berry and leather aromas settle on rustic and rubbery. This has a staunch, acidic feel and stalky, bushy flavors of plum and berry. Chocolate flavors rise up on a rubbery, slightly harsh finish. The blend holds 70% Garnacha and 30% Carignan.\n110304\tSpain\tJavier San Pedro Crianza\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVallobera 2009 Javier San Pedro Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVallobera\tLT_90_Points\tBrambly, leathery and roasted on the nose, this features raspberry and plum aromas in the backdrop.

Ripeness is no issue on the palate, which feels intense but controlled. Flavors of berry fruits and black currant are chocolaty, with herbal spice notes. Finally, a long powerful finish tastes of spice-infused chocolate. Drink through 2023.\n18478\tSpain\tRosado\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIlurce 2010 Rosado Ros??

The palate is full and fun, with acidity and heavier, sweeter flavors of strawberry, raspberry and sweet plum. Handles its size well. Made from 80% Garnacha and 20% Graciano (for acidity).\n61595\tSpain\tCristalino Brut Nature\t85\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJaume Serra 2007 Cristalino Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJaume Serra\tLT_90_Points\tGolden in color, this has bready baked-apple aromas. It feels plump and soft for a brut nature, with a maderized quality to the palate. It tastes extremely dry, like seltzer water blended with citrus, almond and butterscotch. It continues on the same flavor plane throughout the finish.\n55558\tSpain\tCordon Rosado\t88\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Rosado Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tThis is always a really good buy among ros?? sparklers and a personal favorite in the Best Buy category. It opens with red fruit, vanilla and yeasty aromas, but it's racy, crisp and refined in the mouth, with nectarine, peach and controlled citrus flavors. It's dry, spicy and fairly smooth on the finish.\n82743\tSpain\tBardosa\t81\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Lomablanca 2008 Bardosa Tempranillo-Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tBodegas Lomablanca\tLT_90_Points\tBurnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors.

The palate is full and mostly balanced for a warm-vintage, very ripe wine such as this. Flavors of berry, roasted plum and earth finish with raisiny richness and just enough zesty acidity to keep things upright and afloat. Drink through 2018.\n68547\tSpain\tMarqu??s de Valparaiso Crianza\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFederico Paternina 2008 Marqu??s de Valparaiso Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tFederico Paternina\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this wine smells candied for the most part, with a pinch of minerality to go with sweet red berry and red licorice scents.

Earthy flavors of blackberry and plum are straightforward and basic, while the finish hums along with a mild raisiny flavor.\n77858\tSpain\t\t85\t17\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuna Beberide 2010 Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tLuna Beberide\tLT_90_Points\tThe opening aromas of reedy berries are gritty and crusty, while the palate is lively but feels snappy and raw. Flavors of cherry and plum are light, while the finish is straightforward, with a citrusy kick. Not as full and generous as past vintages.\n104171\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tToasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.\n83266\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t88\t20\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMonasterio de las Vi?ñas 2010 Gran Reserva Red (Cari?ñena)\tRed Blend\tMonasterio de las Vi?ñas\tLT_90_Points\tSaucy and spicy up front, this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan also smells a bit leafy and tar-like. A fresh, tomatoey palate suggests spaghetti sauce, while dry, spicy, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with mint and additional spice notes.\n31807\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t49\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tResalte 2001 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tResalte\tLT_90_Points\tMature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.\n112144\tSpain\tAl Muvedre Tinto Joven\t87\t15\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2008 Al Muvedre Tinto Joven Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.\n82703\tSpain\tBrut Reserva\t88\t16\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Gelida 2007 Brut Reserva Pinot Noir (Cava)\tPinot Noir\tMarqu??s de Gelida\tLT_90_Points\tFloral lilac and plum aromas greet you, followed by a chunky, frothy palate with crisp core acidity and toasty flavors of baked cherry and caramel. Finishes smooth and long, with peppery notes and dryness.\n18696\tSpain\t\t85\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTres Ojos 2012 Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tTres Ojos\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a touch stalky and rough on the nose, while in the mouth it's raw, choppy and boxed in. Cherry and plum flavors pick up speed on the palate and taste slightly gamy and burnt on the finish.\n119471\tSpain\tRoble\t83\t7\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPr??ncipe de Viana 2011 Roble Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tPr??ncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tJumpy aromas suggest wet animal fur. In the mouth, there's not a lot of structure or body; flavors of buttery oak and candied berry lack continuity.\n28361\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial\t89\t27\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAdegas Gran Vinum 2015 Selecci??n Especial Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAdegas Gran Vinum\tLT_90_Points\tCitrus, mineral and honey aromas are good but not all that complex. This feels full and weighty, with nectarine and orange flavors. On the finish, dry citrus flavors are round and lasting but low on elegance.

This feels round and easygoing, with soft tannins and modest acidity. Black-plum flavors fly solo, while this is nice but hollow on the finish. Drink now.\n63032\tSpain\t\t86\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValsacro 2010  Rioja\tTempranillo\tValsacro\tLT_90_Points\tAfter this Rioja opens with earthy, almost food-like aromas of ground beef, rubber and leather, oak takes over and in march a bacony scent and plenty of char. This is plump and chunky in feel, with earthy, rubbery, savory flavors of charred black fruits and cured meats. It becomes more and more oaky and drawing on the finish.\n111185\tSpain\t\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontecillo 2002 White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tMontecillo\tLT_90_Points\tSome caramel and candied fruit goes well with the flowery element on the bouquet. In the mouth, lime, peach and mineral run the show. After that comes a clean, light finish with just a hint of stone-fruit flavor. A good mouthfeel ensures that this will be a decent wine for trout caught during the summer.\n79432\tSpain\tAllende\t89\t26\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Allende 2006 Allende  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFinca Allende\tLT_90_Points\tDark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.\n1259\tSpain\t\t85\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tBramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.\n4321\tSpain\tDry Amontillado Los Arcos\t89\t17\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLustau NV Dry Amontillado Los Arcos Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tLustau\tLT_90_Points\tLustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey. It's not super tight or acidic, and thus the palate drips maple and molasses. Medium-bodied and balanced, but with that shot of sugar offset by honest but mellow acids.\n45528\tSpain\tRoble\t85\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConvento Oreja 2012 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tConvento Oreja\tLT_90_Points\tLightly herbal aromas and a touch of animal blend with oak-based notes of sweet plastic and vanilla on the nose. The palate is round but slightly flabby, with moderate acidity. Lactic oak creates a plastic-like flavor that is derivative of the nose, while the finish is drab.\n10364\tSpain\t\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCarravid 2013  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo Blend\tCarravid\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, medicinal cherry and leather aromas come in front of a tight, pointed, firm palate. Medicinal notes carry onto the flavor profile, which is bold and slightly leafy and cool. An aggressive finish with rubbery tannins and juicy intensity indicates that this will last for years to come, should you want to revisit.\n76172\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPenelope Sanchez 2011 Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha-Syrah\tPenelope Sanchez\tLT_90_Points\tAromatically speaking, there's bacon and plastic-like notes to the nose along with generic berry scents. The palate is medium in size and intense, with bold cherry and plum flavors as well as oaky backing. It finishes short, with rubbery accents and a distinct clove flavor.\n11312\tSpain\tAnna Brut Ros??\t87\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorn??u NV Anna Brut Ros?? Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCodorn??u\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, gritty aromas of green lettuce, clove and barrel resin set up a mostly solid and citrusy palate. Oaky base-wine flavors of clove and wood spice rest heavily atop orange notes. The wine tastes peppery, woody and dry on the finish.\n103421\tSpain\t\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSancho Bar??n 2011  Rioja\tTempranillo\tSancho Bar??n\tLT_90_Points\tLeather, meat and rubber aromas run with dark-berry and charred notes on this barrel-heavy Rioja that's full, round, chewy and bit saucy in feel. Baked, oaky flavors of vanilla, mocha and berry fruits finish with a wave of toasty oak and mocha as well as clove. Drink through 2018.\n91224\tSpain\tVi?ña Alarde\t86\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBerberana 2009 Vi?ña Alarde  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBerberana\tLT_90_Points\tBlack cherry and berry jam aromas bring a touch of raisin as well. The palate is mostly fresh and zesty, with medium weight and intensity along with crisp red plum and raspberry flavors. Tight, mildly acidic and a bit toasty on the finish.\n115773\tSpain\tVi?ña Muriel Reserva\t88\t\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2010 Vi?ña Muriel Reserva Chardonnay (Rioja)\tChardonnay\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tButterscotch, vanilla, spiced apple and wood-grain aromas make up an intriguing bouquet. This has lemony acidity and weight to go with leesy lime and apple flavors that turn cidery on the finish.\n28649\tSpain\t\t85\t18\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Albret 2015 Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tFinca Albret\tLT_90_Points\tFlat, earthy raisin and prune aromas in this Garnacha indicate very ripe, almost desiccated fruit. The palate is much like the nose: flat and low on vitality. Jammy blueberry and herbal flavors finish chunky, without lift or nuance.\n111542\tSpain\tFinca Resalso\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmilio Moro 2010 Finca Resalso  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tEmilio Moro\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of minty oak, pastry and jammy raspberry set up a palate that's racy, juicy and somewhat raw feeling, with plum and raspberry flavors.

Earth, mushroom, blackberry and raw oak are all present on the bouquet. Flavors of blackberry and plum are ripe and rich, with an herbal hint. The finish is long, heady, heavy and tannic. Drink through 2018.\n83215\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Riscal 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqu??s de Riscal\tLT_90_Points\tDry, fresh aromas of red fruits come across crisp and racy. The palate follows the nose's lead with medium weight and traditional snappy acidity.

It's thick, but it maintains freshness due to the solid acidity.

After that, things go lightweight and tangy, leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors. A real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else.\n79975\tSpain\tCuv??e KPF\t83\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontebuena 2010 Cuv??e KPF  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMontebuena\tLT_90_Points\tScratchy berry and rubber aromas roll into a grabby, aggressive palate, with a burnt note and resiny oak overshadowing a berry flavor.

This feels solid and tight due to potent acidity, while the flavors lean in the direction of stewed prune and berry. On the finish, flavors of chocolate, cherry and cassis are integrated.\n93303\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2010  Rioja\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tLT_90_Points\tAfter this medium-bodied, fresh-styled Rioja opens with scratchy plum and berry aromas, hints of chocolate and light oak step in.

This shows flavors of plum, berry, herbs and spice, which are standard for Rioja. A lasting finish with mild oak and acidic snap wraps up this easy-to-gauge Crianza.\n30492\tSpain\t\t90\t19\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMorgad??o 2014 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tMorgad??o\tGT_90_Points\tLightly briny aromas of sea foam blend nicely with crisp apple and mineral scents. This is focused on the palate, with a core of acidity and minerality that are the wine's foundation. Apple, orange, mango and melon flavors end clean and minerally.\n31124\tSpain\tVi?ña Albina Crianza\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2014 Vi?ña Albina Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Riojanas\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy aromas of raisin, oak and chocolate are copied on the palate that tastes of oak, vanilla and raisiny fruit.

The palate is more juicy and snappy than some, with no shortage of acidity. Tastes of live-wire cherry and plum, with a long, driving finish. Needs time to settle; drink in late 2010.\n109261\tSpain\t\t86\t20\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tClos Gebrat 2011 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tClos Gebrat\tLT_90_Points\tStalky aromas infiltrate schisty plum and berry scents, while in the mouth this Garnacha-led blend of five grapes is jammy feeling. Stalky, roasted berry flavors are strong, while the finish is stalky tasting and gritty in feel.\n87231\tSpain\tColleita Seleccionada\t85\t22\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRectoral de Amandi 2013 Colleita Seleccionada Menc??a (Ribeira Sacra)\tMenc??a\tRectoral de Amandi\tLT_90_Points\tThis Menc??a smells earthy and a bit stalky. In the mouth, it's grabby along the edges but hollow in the middle. Tomato and herbal red-fruit flavors simmer on the finish with spice notes and raw red-fruit flavors.\n3919\tSpain\tOld Vines\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNisia\tLT_90_Points\tApple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.\n103026\tSpain\tBlanco Fermentado en Barrica\t89\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Otano 2015 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tVi?ña Otano\tLT_90_Points\tThis shimmering barrel-fermented blend of 75% Viura and 25% Tempranillo Blanco opens with stable aromas of apple, butter and fresh corn. An elegant fairly light palate delivers a mix of dry oak, nectarine, peach and apple flavors. This is lithe and comfortable on the finish, with modest but noticeable residual oak.\n51884\tSpain\tAltos Lanzaga\t94\t127\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2009 Altos Lanzaga  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tGT_90_Points\tThe last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic. Flavors of cassis, black cherry and dark plum operate off a mocha base, while the finish is toasty and chocolaty, with a note of black coffee. Best from 2015ƒ??2024.\n70610\tSpain\tBrut Reserva\t86\t22\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata 2009 Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata\tLT_90_Points\tBready, slightly oxidized aromas of yeasty white fruits, vanilla and brine are challenging. In the mouth, this is juicy and intense, with green herbs, brine and pithy citrus flavors. A slightly pickled tasting finish hints at sauerkraut and bitter lime. Prior wines from this producer were better.\n75110\tSpain\tCosecha de Familia\t89\t20\tCentral Spain\tUcl??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Estacada 2013 Cosecha de Familia Syrah-Merlot (Ucl??s)\tSyrah-Merlot\tFinca La Estacada\tLT_90_Points\tRipe and heavy up front, with monster-level oak, this is a bulky, massive blend of Syrah and Merlot. In the mouth, natural and barrel-related tannins are intense, while this tastes mostly of cinnamon, clove and baked berry fruits. Resiny clove-like flavors persist on a tannic beefy finish.\n28259\tSpain\tLuzon Verde\t87\t9\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Luz??n 2010 Luzon Verde Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Luz??n\tLT_90_Points\tThe briary, red fruit aromas are slightly prickly slightly, becoming fuller and deeper with time in glass. This feels solid and fairly dense for the price, with berry, peppery spice and light herb flavors. Fruity and friendly on the finish.\n37704\tSpain\tNegre\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tScala Dei 2010 Negre Garnacha (Priorat)\tGarnacha\tScala Dei\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a stewed, raisiny wine on the nose, while in the mouth it's more acidic and flush, but not quite elegant or sophisticated. The palate deals a short burst of heavy plum and berry flavor, and the finish is jammy and ripe but lacks complexity.\n64812\tSpain\tGot??n del Risc\t85\t14\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad 2008 Got??n del Risc Red (Bierzo)\tRed Blend\tAbad\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with burnt, rubbery aromas that eventually cede to asphalt, roasted peanut and leather. The palate is soft and a bit hollow in the middle, with earthy, rubbery flavors of black plum and berry. Finishes with cola, bitter coffee and root beer flavors. Decent and full overall, but rubbery.\n124070\tSpain\tFinca La Planeta\t92\t44\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller Pasanau 2008 Finca La Planeta Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCeller Pasanau\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of spiced cherry and cassis are schisty and belie this Cabernet-heavy wine's age. A narrow palate with firm tannins and not much give sets up flavors of oak, lemon peel, plum and berry fruits. A lasting finish with deep berry flavors and a topping of oak doesn't lose steam. Drink through 2025.\n101023\tSpain\tSeis Meses\t83\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHesvera 2014 Seis Meses  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tHesvera\tLT_90_Points\tUntamed, foxy aromas of wild berry, bramble bush and olive come in front of a palate with nails for tannins. This tastes highly herbal or mildly green, depending on how you look at it. A raw, hot finish renders this low on charm.\n7170\tSpain\t\t90\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontespina 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tMontespina\tGT_90_Points\tFresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out.\n113880\tSpain\tReserva\t93\t27\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2010 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tGT_90_Points\tCrisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030.\n129187\tSpain\tPremium Selection\t84\t9\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPluvium 2015 Premium Selection Bobal-Cabernet Sauvignon (Valencia)\tBobal-Cabernet Sauvignon\tPluvium\tLT_90_Points\tMild, dusty cherry aromas set up a pulling, dry palate. Flavors of tea and spiced tomato lack fruit, and this wine is dry and somewhat abrasive on the finish. The blend is 80% Bobal with Cabernet Sauvignon.\n67240\tSpain\tEl Fanio\t87\t20\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2015 El Fanio Xarel-lo (Pened??s)\tXarel-lo\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.\n95893\tSpain\tReserva\t84\t40\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Tomares 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarques de Tomares\tLT_90_Points\tBaked, saucy aromas suggest the wine's overall character. It's ripe and stewy, with a grippy palate and a flavor profile full of tomato, herbs and red plum.

This simple blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo feels grabby and rubbery, while salty baked-plum flavors finish with notes of herbs and mint.\n92177\tSpain\t\t87\t35\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\t\t\tCampo Alegre 2007  Toro\tTinta de Toro\tCampo Alegre\tLT_90_Points\tNot as rich and fruity as most Lurton wines from Toro, which we think reflects the cooler, wetter conditions of the '07 vintage. The nose is definitively red in nature, with spice and raspberry, while the palate is fairly tight and generic. Finishes with grab and astringency along with the taste of milk chocolate.\n106572\tSpain\tCastell de Raimat\t85\t11\tCatalonia\tCosters del Segre\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRaimat 2012 Castell de Raimat Albari?ño (Costers del Segre)\tAlbari?ño\tRaimat\tLT_90_Points\tMelon and white-fruit aromas are more generic than specific. This has a lively, fresh mouthfeel, along with flavors of nectarine, melon and persimmon. A lasting finish has a racy feel but offers nothing more in terms of flavors or complexity.\n53531\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca del Marquesado 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca del Marquesado\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, lightly baked berry, raisin and tobacco aromas are a touch leafy but comported.

Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.\n44074\tSpain\tBrut\t86\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tS?ÿniger 2007 Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tS?ÿniger\tLT_90_Points\tA neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose.

The mouthfeel is full and tomatoey, with snappy acidity pushing minty, herbal flavors of red plum, currant and raspberry. A light, medicinal flavor defines the finish.\n16993\tSpain\t\t84\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRios de Tinta 2012  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tRios de Tinta\tLT_90_Points\tCandied cherry and strawberry aromas are fruity but rudimentary.

Almost syrupy in its richness but not fully; it's chewy and creamy, with vital acids. The flavors are mega ripe and rich, emphasizing blackberry, black cherry preserves, fudge and fig paste. Yet at the same time it's an ethereal wine; the epitome of modern Rioja.

A smooth, creamy nose of vanilla, oak and berry aromas leads to a ripe, saturated palate with a meaty texture. Flavors of black fruits, wild herbs, licorice and spice are long, savory and chocolaty on a finish that lasts three minutes. Drink from 2019ƒ??2030.\n43917\tSpain\t\t93\t61\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSan Vicente 2012  Rioja\tTempranillo\tSan Vicente\tGT_90_Points\tThis modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness.

Toasty blackberry and pronounced oak flavors culminate on a big, lush and grabby finish. This is excellent, though a bit bold and burly; drink through 2022.\n48323\tSpain\tVi?ña Pomal Reserva\t90\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Bilbainas 2010 Vi?ña Pomal Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Bilbainas\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the epitome of a composed, approachable Rioja reserva; it's earthy and dry up front, with aromas of fine herbs, brandied cherry and plum. A solid palate houses oaky flavors of vanilla and butter in addition to plum and currant, while the finish is dry, elegant and oaky enough to give off a popcorn-like character.

A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.\n84924\tSpain\tSelecci??n Personal\t90\t36\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmina 2008 Selecci??n Personal Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tEmina\tGT_90_Points\tAn interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.\n73690\tSpain\tRoyal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado\t91\t25\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSandeman NV Royal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tSandeman\tGT_90_Points\tQuite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact.\n72123\tSpain\tReserva Familiar Nature Mil-l??ssima\t86\t22\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixa Rigau NV Reserva Familiar Nature Mil-l??ssima Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixa Rigau\tLT_90_Points\tWith no dosage, this wine carries a grassy, raw sort of nose. In the mouth, there's potent lemon, green banana and citric bite. On the plus side, the balance and character are commendable and the depth and power of fruit are solid. Detracting from that is a lack of subtlety. Fast and flavorful, but edgy.\n52523\tSpain\tSweet Reserva\t87\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuv?? y Camps NV Sweet Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tJuv?? y Camps\tLT_90_Points\tA hint of lemon-lime characterizes an otherwise neutral nose.

A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020.\n56114\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos de Valcerracin 2013 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPagos de Valcerracin\tLT_90_Points\tFig and raisin aromas blend with damp earth and animal notes on the nose of this grippy, bumpy crianza lacks focus but is still quite good. Black cherry, herbal plum and toasty oak flavors finish sticky and with lasting oak.

This has a fresh simple plump feel and nice but basic melon and lime flavors. A clean finish with firm acidity keeps this chugging along until the final whistle.\n72111\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCostaval 2006 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tCostaval\tLT_90_Points\tƒ??Robleƒ?� means oak and there's no shortage of oak on this youngster. The nose smells almost like melted cheese and bread at first, but then it settles and lets out subtle leather and fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh, with forward black cherry and plum flavors. Definitely lively, and with no tricks up its sleeve.\n71158\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tStorks' Tower 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tSauvignon Blanc-Verdejo\tStorks' Tower\tLT_90_Points\tPungent citrus aromas settle on grapefruit.

A standard feeling finish is fresh, citrusy in flavor and mildly bitter.\n97182\tSpain\t\t80\t17\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad Dom Bueno 2007 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tAbad Dom Bueno\tLT_90_Points\tEggy, sulfuric and gritty on the nose, with acrid, burnt-field aromas. The palate runs toward grapefruit and bland citrus, and the finish is dull. Barely an acceptable effort given the norm these days.\n21690\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontecillo 2007 Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tMontecillo\tLT_90_Points\tDusty and dry smelling, with apple and lettuce on the nose.

Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.\n21746\tSpain\tColeccion 125 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica\t84\t54\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Juli?­n Chivite 2008 Coleccion 125 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Navarra)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas Juli?­n Chivite\tLT_90_Points\tNutty, oaky aromas along with a gold-brown maderized color indicate a wine past its prime. In the mouth, there's not much fruit left but there is a whole lot of weight and resiny oak. Lead flavors of almond and walnut oil suggest Sherry more than Chardonnay.\n14557\tSpain\tVarietales\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2012 Varietales  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tThis red-fruit-dominated Garnacha smells of earthy cherry and plum along with orange peel. A racy, chewy, slightly rough palate of pie cherry, red plum, raisin and chocolate finish juicy and aggressive.\n47388\tSpain\t\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOro de Castilla 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tOro de Castilla\tLT_90_Points\tTouches of warm radiator dust and minerality accent citrus aromas.

This has a heavy disposition on the palate despite spritz. Flavors of mango, nectarine and green herbs come with a touch of bell pepper prior to a bulky finish with apple notes.\n60782\tSpain\tTempranillo Syrah\t83\t17\tCentral Spain\tMadrid\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSombrero 2005 Tempranillo Syrah Red (Madrid)\tRed Blend\tSombrero\tLT_90_Points\tLots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins. It finally settles and smooths out with airing, but requires too much compromise on the part of the drinker. Has its good points but not enough of them.\n49380\tSpain\t\t83\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAnalivia 2011 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tAnalivia\tLT_90_Points\tThis is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.\n25652\tSpain\t\t84\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2011 Ros?? (Rioja)\tRos??\tSierra Cantabria\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine looks clear, with aromas of chewing gum, watermelon and cherry. The palate is regular and nebulous in feel, while flavors of melon and peach are slightly oxidized and pithy. A blend of 50% Tempranillo with 30% Garnacha and 20% Viura.\n19697\tSpain\tReserva Heredad Brut\t88\t20\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tAlways one of Catalonia's more elevated cavas, this version opens with spiced dried apple aromas and a bit of yeast and dough. The palate is both sweet and tangy, with tangerine as the lead fruit. And the finish is consistent and moderately deep. A handsome wine with character. Imported by Freixenet USA.\n109631\tSpain\tM??todo Tradicional Brut\t82\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Cantos?­n NV M??todo Tradicional Brut Sparkling (Rueda)\tSparkling Blend\tVi?ña Cantos?­n\tLT_90_Points\tBriney and cidery smelling, with a heavy, disjointed, cloying palate.

The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.\n77871\tSpain\tTorre la Moreira\t85\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Vizhoja 2011 Torre la Moreira Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tMarqu??s de Vizhoja\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this Albari?ño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.\n113590\tSpain\tPremium\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tQuo 2010 Premium Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tQuo\tLT_90_Points\tThe bouquet on this Garnacha is mildly raisiny, with cola, mint and medicinal accents.

A nice mix of vanilla, root beer, spice, plum and chocolate aromas reflect 18 months in oak. With full stout tannins and deep ripe flavors of plum, cassis, tobacco and chocolate, this barrel-influenced middleweight should age nicely through 2022.\n49952\tSpain\tAAA\t93\t250\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?ñon 2010 AAA Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tRed Blend\tMarques de Gri?ñon\tGT_90_Points\tThis black-colored, opaque bruiser is as concentrated as wine gets before crossing the line. Aromas of gritty black fruits are amped up, while the palate pounds with extraction and tannins. Huge flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with more muscle than finesse. This is ultra ripe Graciano and Petit Verdot that nobody would describe as shy. Drink through 2020.\n74346\tSpain\tTinto\t83\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tChispas 2011 Tinto Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tChispas\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a prickly, slightly raspy wine with a lean, grabby feel and briny, pickled flavors of herbal red-berry fruits.

Plum is the key fruit aroma, and that's followed by a tight, firm body with toasty oak, black fruit flavors, herbal notes and peppery spice. Quick and a touch hot on the finish.\n65085\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortia 2015 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPortia\tLT_90_Points\tThis young, oaky Tinto Fino opens with charred aromas, but soon scents transition to cheesy and chocolaty. This wine is bullish in texture, with a ton of oak-driven clove, spice and burnt flavors. For the most part, fruit is not a big factor, as the ƒ??robleƒ?� in this wine drives the car.\n98726\tSpain\tCrianza Tradicional\t85\t15\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampo Lindo 2009 Crianza Tradicional Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Catalunya)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tCampo Lindo\tLT_90_Points\tRipe, soft and pillowy on the nose, this blend is wide and lazy on the palate, with raisin and prune flavors offset by moderate acidity.

Low vibrancy and bounce on the palate create a sense of flat heaviness. Salty peach and melon flavors are buried in wood spice, while this tastes dry, pithy and resiny on a mild finish.\n2916\tSpain\tEnglora\t86\t21\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCellers Baronia del Montsant 2010 Englora Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tCellers Baronia del Montsant\tLT_90_Points\tReduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.\n104706\tSpain\t\t86\t10\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos del Cuco 2010 Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tAltos del Cuco\tLT_90_Points\tInteresting aromas of brick dust, mint, fall leaf and dried fruit seem traditional and familiar.

The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum. A bit of mineral and natural bitterness work the finish, and overall this is a no-complaints kind of $10 wine.\n121309\tSpain\tThird Generation 70th Anniversary\t87\t24\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fari?ña 2009 Third Generation 70th Anniversary  (Toro)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Fari?ña\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of baked earth blend with sassy, almost prickly cherry and leather notes in front of what amounts to a dense, slightly gummy feeling palate.

Stout and layered in the mouth, with full tannins and a nice mix of bold berry flavors, tobacco, herbs, spice and lemony oak. Tastes similar on the finish, with tobacco and spice lasting the longest. Complex and healthy; drink now through 2018.\n1358\tSpain\tTinto\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBurgo Viejo 2011 Tinto  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBurgo Viejo\tLT_90_Points\tThis Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma.

It's dark as night, with dusty aromas of cola, cocoa, marzipan, blackberry and spice all rolled into a finessed whole. Feels tight as a drum but balanced, with monstrous flavors of boysenberry, cassis, peppercorn, baking spices and chocolate. Young and raring to go; hold until 2013 then drink through 2018.\n49377\tSpain\tReserva\t83\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Hermosa 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Hermosa\tLT_90_Points\tBroken up on the nose, with a nutty, leafy set of over-the-hill aromas.

Alongside these notes are mild tannins, some rubbery weight and chunky friendliness.\n56027\tSpain\tSagra\t82\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz 2011 Sagra  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCruz\tLT_90_Points\tDominant aromas of char and rubber give way to chocolaty oak and vanilla on what amounts to a confected, forced bouquet. This feels flush and oaky. Flavors of creamy oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and herbal berry finish resiny and woody.\n14182\tSpain\tFinca Ygay Reserva\t90\t26\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Murrieta 2008 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s de Murrieta\tGT_90_Points\tEarthy, dry aromas of plum and cherry come with notes of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and leather. This feels fresh, acidic and generally well balanced. Flavors of spiced plum and berry are riper than many 2008s from Rioja, while a finish with tobacco and leathery flavors is solid and fairly long. Drink through 2020.\n16560\tSpain\t\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTape?ña 2010 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tVerdejo\tTape?ña\tLT_90_Points\tLight in every way, from color to bouquet to weight to flavors.

This is intense on the palate, with strong acidity that lends tartness to sinewy plum and berry flavors. Minor accents of spice and toast finish with espresso bitterness. Drink through 2020.\n33954\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPr??ncipe de Viana 2006 Reserva Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tPr??ncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tHarmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.\n16464\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSpanish Vines 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (La Mancha)\tSauvignon Blanc\tSpanish Vines\tLT_90_Points\tRecommended with caution. The sample this note is based on was weighty and smooth, with apple and floral notes and then an almosty buttery palate with baked apple and citrus flavors. Oddly, it's a soft, ripe wine that's fading and not showing much Sauvignon Blanc typicity.\n91175\tSpain\tBikandi Crianza\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Olabarri 2008 Bikandi Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Olabarri\tLT_90_Points\tSpice and dark fruit aromas settle fairly well.

The palate strikes hard with tannic clamp and reduction. Flavors run lemony and herbal, with star anise and cardamom mixing with berry fruit. Clacky and tight on the finish, but serious and complex. 350 cases made; drink now through 2012.\n72412\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampo Viejo 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCampo Viejo\tLT_90_Points\tFairly light and leathery, with strained aromas of animal hide and burnt berry fruit. The palate feel is light to medium, with scratchiness, and the flavors are of roasted fruit, leather and dryness. Spice and a slight bitterness define the finish. Has a few issues but still a good wine for $10.\n90533\tSpain\tEmeritus\t92\t90\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?ñon 2011 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tCabernet Blend\tMarques de Gri?ñon\tGT_90_Points\tEmeritus is a blend of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon with Petit Verdot and Syrah filling out the form. Dense earthy aromas of blackberry come with a note of graphite, while the oak on this bruiser smells a bit cheesy. Pounding blackberry and chocolate-cake flavors finish oaky, toasty, baked and incredibly ripe. Drink this massive wine through 2023.\n95218\tSpain\tBrut\t84\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Subirats NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tConde de Subirats\tLT_90_Points\tDusty white-fruit aromas are grassy and smell of vitamins.

This is a bright, healthy, fruity red with plum, wild berry and a touch of oaky vanilla on the flavor profile. A chunky, chewy, plump finish with a toasty note closes it out. Drink through 2018.\n49374\tSpain\tChardonnay-Viura-Muscat\t83\t11\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos de Luz 2010 Chardonnay-Viura-Muscat White (Cari?ñena)\tWhite Blend\tCampos de Luz\tLT_90_Points\tAs it smells blowsy, stalky and oily, this is probably already past its freshness point. It feels chunky and sort of flat, with mealy apple flavors leading to a honeyed finish that feels fleshy. This is a blend of 50% Viura, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Muscat.\n115798\tSpain\tEmeritus\t92\t75\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?ñon 2003 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tRed Blend\tMarques de Gri?ñon\tGT_90_Points\tHiding behind Gri?ñon's impressive 2004s is this ultrapremium blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Emeritus is sweet and ripe with pipe tobacco, cassis, spice cake and chocolate aromas. It's immense and inviting, with grabby, plump blackberry fruit along with cinnamon, mocha and cola notes. Creamy, rich and almost unctuous. Drink over the next five years. 200 cases made.\n112745\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\t??bano 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\t??bano\tLT_90_Points\tStarts out oaky and cheesy, with baked berry, leather and clove-like aromas. The palate has lots of size, clacky tannins and acidity, while flavors of berry, mocha and tobacco are nice and lead to a toasty, grabby finish. Typical for RDD in that it's tough and tannic but full of brash flavor; drink nowƒ??2015.\n42891\tSpain\tMonte Oton\t89\t7\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2008 Monte Oton Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tOn the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build. Whole, concentrated and shows good structure, depth and character. About as good as inexpensive Garnacha gets.\n4016\tSpain\tBrut Reserva Ros??\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLlopart 2010 Brut Reserva Ros??

The body and palate are lean and a little stripped, but the apple flavors are clean and quaffable. This is like a waif model, or maybe a scarecrow. It is good on the surface but has very little meat on the bones.\n114002\tSpain\tAltos de Losada\t92\t44\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2010 Altos de Losada Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tLosada\tGT_90_Points\tInitially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.\n95247\tSpain\tOld Vines\t83\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarnacha de Fuego 2011 Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tGarnacha de Fuego\tLT_90_Points\tPrune and raisin aromas pour off the bouquet, providing more than a clue that this wine is on the overripe side. That's confirmed in the mouth, where things feel tannic and over the top; flavors of raisin, sugar beet and chocolate finish with heat and hardness.\n91898\tSpain\tBarrel Fermented\t86\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReina de Castilla 2014 Barrel Fermented Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tReina de Castilla\tLT_90_Points\tBriny aromas are less than fruity. This feels oily and round, with flavors of tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango set against nectarine and stone-fruit notes. Plump on the finish, with a slightly bitter aftertaste.\n77422\tSpain\tPrivilegio\t87\t43\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRibas del C?§a 2003 Privilegio Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tRibas del C?§a\tLT_90_Points\tGassy and funky out of the chute, with spice, licorice and aromas that hint at both richness and oak. The palate is ripe, roasted and tilts toward dark berry, plum and raisin, while the finish is round, medicinal and warming. Very much like the basic C?§a 2003 Bierzo, with a little more precision. Seems a little fat and hollow, but it makes its point.\n82848\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Herminia 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ña Herminia\tLT_90_Points\tMinty, scratchy aromas of cherry and berry air out well.

A combination of choppy tannins and high acidity make for a jumpy mouthfeel, while acid-propelled flavors of plum and raspberry are fiery and long. Drink this organic blend of Garnacha Tintorera, Monastrell and Syrah through 2019.\n104687\tSpain\tBrut Nature Reserva\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tS?ÿniger NV Brut Nature Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tS?ÿniger\tLT_90_Points\tDusty and straightforward on the nose, this has aromas of pear and apple.

It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup. Great as a dessert wine with cake or blue cheese, but also as a topping for vanilla or coffee ice cream.\n66952\tSpain\tBrunus\t87\t28\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Montsant 2010 Brunus Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tPortal del Montsant\tLT_90_Points\tBerry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.\n53849\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tR+ 2012  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tR+\tLT_90_Points\tBurnt smelling like charred steak, this also offers raw oak scents along with boysenberry aromas.

It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.\n62159\tSpain\tFermentado en Barrica\t90\t20\tGalicia\tRibeiro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Mein 2008 Fermentado en Barrica White (Ribeiro)\tWhite Blend\tVi?ña Mein\tGT_90_Points\tThe label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albari?ño.\n17249\tSpain\tExcelencia\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Excelencia Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tPickled and leesy on the nose, this kosher Cava runs low on verve and bubbles.

But this horsey, funky number goes beyond vintage conditions. It's unfocused, citric, leafy and green, with a hammering finish. Bottom line: this is not what you want from Ribera del Duero.\n42737\tSpain\tG Gago\t92\t32\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2011 G Gago  (Toro)\tTempranillo\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tGT_90_Points\tThis opens with offbeat floral and perfumed aromas of berry fruits and oak.

Candied melon and lime flavors finish short, with residual sweetness.\n1759\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tAlmansa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNiel Santofimia 2013 Red (Almansa)\tRed Blend\tNiel Santofimia\tLT_90_Points\tCharred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.\n99810\tSpain\tEsencia Divi?ña\t89\t22\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAdegas Gran Vinum 2007 Esencia Divi?ña Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAdegas Gran Vinum\tLT_90_Points\tWith each vintage this estate improves, but at the top of the Albari?ño price tier it should be at least this good. There are lemon, almond and creamy aromas preceding apple, pear and melon flavors. The finish is clean, a little dusty and shows a hint of cider. Intricate enough, with fine overall balance.\n61360\tSpain\tAlma de Blanco\t83\t14\tGalicia\tMonterrei\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo das Tapias 2012 Alma de Blanco Godello (Monterrei)\tGodello\tPazo das Tapias\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral aromas suggest pear and mealy apple across the palate but lacking in definition. Flavors of stone fruits and apple are short on freshness; this is plump and low on acidity come finishing time.\n33074\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFern?­ndez de Pi??rola 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFern?­ndez de Pi??rola\tLT_90_Points\tSavory berry aromas are accompanied by spice notes and a hint of latex. This feels wide rather than precisely shaped. Baked, earthy, oaky flavors envelop stewed berry notes, and the wine feels wayward on the finish.\n55153\tSpain\tRosado Brut\t87\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMont Mar??al 2013 Rosado Brut Trepat (Cava)\tTrepat\tMont Mar??al\tLT_90_Points\tRusty in color, with soft aromas of cherry and plum, this ros?? of Trepat feels fleshy and round, with modest acidity. Briny citrus and charred cherry notes unfold on the finish.\n106529\tSpain\t??N/2\t88\t23\tSpanish Islands\tVi de la Terra Mallorca\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\t??nima Negra 2009 ??N/2 Red (Vi de la Terra Mallorca)\tRed Blend\t??nima Negra\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a unique wine from Mallorca with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Clampy, dry and tannic on the palate, it's full of savory, roasted barbecue flavors along with tomato and red fruit notes. Very Mallorcan in that it's salty and savory from start to finish.\n125825\tSpain\tValdemoreda Rosado\t80\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas del Mundo 2011 Valdemoreda Rosado Garnacha (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tBodegas del Mundo\tLT_90_Points\tStrawberry and raspberry aromas set up a reedy, flush palate with stemmy, candied strawberry flavors. Turns green and bitter on the finish.\n51521\tSpain\tRoble\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatiz 2010 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMatiz\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells a bit like asphalt and peanuts. It feels angular, with plum, berry and pepper flavors. The finish is spicy, with drying tannins and a lasting leafy flavor.\n114627\tSpain\tS?ÿtirs Negre\t86\t18\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCeller Arch?? Pag??s 2005 S?ÿtirs Negre Red (Empord?ÿ)\tRed Blend\tCeller Arch?? Pag??s\tLT_90_Points\tStarts with rubbery, flat berry aromas but rounds out with air. It's tight and rocking with tannins as dark fruit flavors take control. Shows weight and darkness on the finish. Grenache, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n64787\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tFamiliar Rioja aromas of cigar box, baking spices and dried cherry introduce a dense, sinewy palate. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate include peppery spice notes, which are balanced on the way out.\n102217\tSpain\t\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tManyana 2015 Tempranillo (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo\tManyana\tLT_90_Points\tMedicinal berry aromas show a touch of nail polish. Tight and high in acidity, this deals limited plum flavors with earthy undertones. A short finish is grapy in flavor but doesn't last long despite acidic push.\n33135\tSpain\tCune\t85\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2014 Cune Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tCVNE\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of latex, strawberry and raspberry Kool-Aid are fine but reticent. Choppy, citric and high in acidity, this has a tight mouthfeel to go with semitart flavors of pink grapefruit and tangerine. Citric acidity drives the finish, which is tangy and intense.\n18913\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t44\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos G??ticos 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tCampos G??ticos\tLT_90_Points\tRugged, rustic, stalky aromas are a bit challenging. In the mouth, this is stout and tough, with hard tannins. Toasty blackberry flavors are mildly stalky and earthy, with peppery bitterness, while a firm, tight, tannic finish tastes of black peppercorn and blackberry. Drink through 2028.\n86701\tSpain\tAnta?ño\t82\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ. Garcia Carrion 2011 Anta?ño Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tJ. Garcia Carrion\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens with oxidized, creamy aromas while the palate offers mostly acidic, tart citrus flavors that are surrounded by oxidized stone-fruit notes. The finish ends nutty.\n15606\tSpain\tOak Aged\t80\t17\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReula 2003 Oak Aged Tempranillo-Merlot (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo-Merlot\tReula\tLT_90_Points\tBest on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.\n27294\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Mayor 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tVi?ña Mayor\tLT_90_Points\tTarry upfront aromas of berry fruits, pencil lead and shoe polish announce plenty of oak. The mouthfeel on this young Toro is full and grabby, while flavors of blackberry, oak and related mint finish peppery and blackened, with residual minty oak.\n74331\tSpain\tGlobal Garnacha\t83\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPushpin 2011 Global Garnacha Ros?? (Campo de Borja)\tRos??\tPushpin\tLT_90_Points\tDusty cherry and plum aromas are nothing special. The palate is similarly just OK, with stalky flavors of citrus and red fruits. This is lightly oxidized and pithy tasting on the finish.\n95389\tSpain\t\t86\t8\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sindoa 2009 Tempranillo (Navarra)\tTempranillo\tVega Sindoa\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly rubbery on first impression, but cleaner and better as it opens up. Zesty and full of acidic punch, with juicy black cherry and plum flavors. Registers as healthy and ripe, with a spot of medicinality. Quite good for the price.\n66757\tSpain\tDom Ramon Imperial\t85\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Aragonesas 2013 Dom Ramon Imperial Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Aragonesas\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and black plum aromas are oaky and smoky. Full, blocky and a bit awkward on the palate, this Garnacha tastes of minty, oaky clove, roasted plum and black currant. A saucy, semi-oaked finish is solid enough.\n41307\tSpain\tS-Naia\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNaia 2014 S-Naia Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda)\tSauvignon Blanc\tNaia\tLT_90_Points\tPungent, feline aromas of sweat and cactus set up a sharp, citric palate that's loaded to the brim with acidity. Austere flavors of passion fruit and lime end with a note of mango along with a wave of citric burn.\n74332\tSpain\tBlanco\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReal Compa?ñia de Vinos 2011 Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tWhite Blend\tReal Compa?ñia de Vinos\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of 70% Viura with Verdejo and Sauvigon Blanc smells a lot like Bartlett pear juice. In the mouth, it's fleshy and dilute, with briny grapefruit and a pithy tasting finish.\n11378\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Labastida 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCastillo Labastida\tLT_90_Points\tSpunky and mildly abrasive on the nose, this has some punch and character. It feels fresh, lean and narrow, with a traditional Rioja mix of herb-influenced red-fruit and dry spice notes. The mild finish offers tobacco and raspberry flavors.\n42184\tSpain\tOrganic Wine\t82\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres 2015 Organic Wine  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres\tLT_90_Points\tFunky horsey murky aromas suggest compost and sweaty animal. A blocky grabby palate and disjointed woody and weedy flavors finish with foxy notes. Nothing about this organic wine impresses.\n29403\tSpain\tSparkling\t88\t21\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPallas NV Sparkling Muscat (M?­laga)\tMuscat\tPallas\tLT_90_Points\tFairly neutral smelling, this feels fresh and not cloying. Lychee and honeydew flavors are basic and composed, while the finish is short.\n43395\tSpain\tSeleccion\t83\t14\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\t\t\tRen?? Barbier 1999 Seleccion Chardonnay (Pened??s)\tChardonnay\tRen?? Barbier\tLT_90_Points\tLoads of oak over golden apple fruit and mild tropical notes make this a New World wannabe. It's medium weight but overblown, and the flavors are fundamentally out of balance. Still, there are some folks who just want a little fruit with their oak. ƒ??M.M.\n99138\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tThe first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued. The palate brings good weight and lightly leafy, tomatoey accents to red cherry and raspberry flavors. Light, dry and a little stemmy on the finish. Standard but hinting at elegant.\n92293\tSpain\tPieza el Caidero\t84\t21\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Langa 2012 Pieza el Caidero Grenache (Calatayud)\tGrenache\tBodegas Langa\tLT_90_Points\tThis varietal Garnacha is chunky and heavily oaked on the nose, with woody aromas of vanilla and plastic. An overtly oaky, awkward feeling palate tastes of resin on top of plum and blackberry, while the finish shows more resin mixed with mint.\n55902\tSpain\t\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPe?ña Roble 2011  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tPe?ña Roble\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is quite fruity on the nose. Next, it's dense and solid in the mouth, however the flavors turn quickly towards syrupy berry and stewed black fruits. A raisin-like flavor pops up on the finish to accompany chewy tannins and a pasty feeling residue.\n119775\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo 2009 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tJammy aromas of ripe but flat berry fruits and tree bark settle on medicinal and rooty. This feels solid but a touch soupy, with leafy, herbal plum and raspberry flavors. An herbal, saucy tasting finish is easygoing, with drying tannins.\n52073\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t82\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Jauregui 2009 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tConde de Jauregui\tLT_90_Points\tSmells like tarmac and tire rubber initially, and it remains stemmy and staunch even with air. The feel is dilute yet edgy, and the flavors suggest generic red berry and a dash of spice. Fades quickly on the finish, which is probably a good thing.\n91902\tSpain\tVII\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Faustino 2015 VII Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tBodegas Faustino\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, crisp and more neutral and competent than exciting is how to best describe this racy but lightweight Viura. A citric palate issues short, tangy lime flavors, while the finish is juicy, lean and tight.\n34049\tSpain\t\t89\t22\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaco & Lola 2013 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tPaco & Lola\tLT_90_Points\tDusty peach and apple aromas fold in stony mineral notes as well as leesy scents. This feels solid, properly acidic and a bit pulpy. Flavors of apple cider and peach pit finish with citrusy acidity.\n29715\tSpain\tRosa Nautica\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Gitana 2014 Rosa Nautica White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tLa Gitana\tLT_90_Points\tGrapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.\n101310\tSpain\t\t82\t15\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sindoa 2014 Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tVega Sindoa\tLT_90_Points\tStalky and foul on the nose, this Chardonnay doesn't smell inviting. Oily and heavy on the palate, this tastes of resiny oak, related cream and bland white fruits.\n9077\tSpain\tFlor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia\t89\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVetus 2016 Flor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tVetus\tLT_90_Points\tWhite-fruit aromas and a prickly scent of cactus or nettle opens this tight, citrusy old-vines Verdejo. Matching the aromas, this tastes of pithy citrus, grapefruit and green herbs. A racy finish fades out nicely.\n107671\tSpain\tFincas de la Villa Reserva\t90\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2011 Fincas de la Villa Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tGT_90_Points\tBaked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021.\n93385\tSpain\t12 Crianza\t92\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarc??a Figuero 2011 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarc??a Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tGrilled aromas of fresh asphalt and slightly murky berry fruits improve with airing, as does a full-bodied palate with big tannins. Toasty, spicy flavors of herbal berry and cassis show good complexity but are far from tame. Finishing flavors of chocolate and pepper are dry and woody. Drink through 2027.\n43969\tSpain\tPrestigio\t91\t70\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatarromera 2005 Prestigio  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMatarromera\tGT_90_Points\tDeep and dark, with cola, blackberry and mossy aromas. This is full-bodied, tight and tannic, with hardness that will only be tempered by food and/or more time in bottle. Tastes bold, chunky and ripe, with chocolate and licorice along with heat and tannic fire. Drink now through 2017.\n65754\tSpain\tPrado Enea Gran Reserva\t92\t62\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2006 Prado Enea Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMuga\tGT_90_Points\tCedar, char and blackberry aromas are full and ripe on the nose. Given the wine's age, its structure and tannic weight are just right. Earthy, lightly roasted flavors of spiced raspberry and plum finish peppery and dry. Drink through 2020.\n81994\tSpain\tMas de Masos\t91\t70\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCapafons-Oss?? 2003 Mas de Masos Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCapafons-Oss??\tGT_90_Points\tBig, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.\n73474\tSpain\tIdus\t94\t50\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2012 Idus Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tRipe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.\n72069\tSpain\tBlanc Selecci??\t87\t16\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHuguet de Can Feixes 2013 Blanc Selecci?? White (Pened??s)\tWhite Blend\tHuguet de Can Feixes\tLT_90_Points\tCidery apple and stone-fruit aromas are fresh and basic. This blend includes Chardonnay, Macabeo and Parellada, and it's a lively number with spritz and citric acidity. Orange and tangerine flavors remain zesty and snappy on the finish.\n28266\tSpain\tRosado Fermentado en Barrica\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPradorey 2011 Rosado Fermentado en Barrica Ros?? (Ribera del Duero)\tRos??\tPradorey\tLT_90_Points\tRed berry and mild matchstick aromas augment the resiny oak scents from being barrel fermentation. It's juicy, fresh and healthy in the mouth, with a mix of red fruit and stone fruit flavors and a finish that's mild, consistent and long.\n77122\tSpain\t\t88\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCruz de Piedra 2011 Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tCruz de Piedra\tLT_90_Points\tFor $10 this is a serious, powerful Garnacha with concentration and purity. The palate feels both crisp and lifted as well as dense and concentrated. There's quality to the flavor profile, which offers rubbery, dense blueberry along with blackberry. Rarely does a value-priced wine show this much weight and texture.\n27305\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial 1\t88\t18\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co. 2011 Selecci??n Especial 1 Moscatel (M?­laga)\tMoscatel\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co.\tLT_90_Points\tDust, lime, lychee, thyme and oregano aromas create a complex bouquet. It is round in texture but also juicy due to core acidity. Flavors of lychee, melon and spiced apple rest on a full body. Finishing notes of herbs and tropical fruits are fresh and appealing.\n47218\tSpain\tTorreping??n Reserva\t89\t38\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPing??n 2011 Torreping??n Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPing??n\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of vanilla, herbs, black cherry, plum and dried cheese are sturdy and nice. This feels expansive, with chewy weight. Oaky flavors of vanilla, blackberry and dark plum are leathery and finish long, spicy and toasted. Drink through 2022.\n35767\tSpain\t\t86\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos Reales 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tCampos Reales\tLT_90_Points\tDark in color, with concentrated, jammy aromas of wild berry and plum. Offers a big body given that it's a $7 La Mancha varietal, with concentration, solid structure and full, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and baked fig. Short but stout on the finish.\n45337\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t93\t149\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArzuaga 2004 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tArzuaga\tGT_90_Points\tFor aged Ribera del Duero, this is right on target. An elegant, lightly leafy nose with lemony oak and tobacco notes along with dried berry and plum aromas is spot on and classy. The palate feels plump and honest, with moderate tannins. Flavors of earthy plum and berry, tobacco and a pantry's worth of spice finish full and chunky. Drink through 2022.\n59803\tSpain\tPago Gardu?ña\t93\t110\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbadia Retuerta 2004 Pago Gardu?ña Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tSyrah\tAbadia Retuerta\tGT_90_Points\tBig, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction. Probably better in another year or so.\n126608\tSpain\tBrut Exclusive Gran Reserva\t88\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Gelida 2010 Brut Exclusive Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarqu??s de Gelida\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of waffles and corn flakes suggest maturity and complexity. This feels open and wide, with depth to the palate. Direct flavors of lime and tangerine finish more citric and minerally than the nose, with a lasting sense of freshness.\n15303\tSpain\t\t89\t16\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondes de Albarei 2013 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tCondes de Albarei\tLT_90_Points\tGreen apple, peach and a touch of saline define the nose of this wine. It's fresh in feel, like drinking nectarine juice. Flavors of nectarine, green plum, peach and lime finish clean and minerally, with refreshing acidity.\n24032\tSpain\tCentenaria\t87\t16\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCoto de Hayas 2013 Centenaria Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tCoto de Hayas\tLT_90_Points\tThis heavily oaked Garnacha smells largely of campfire and char. A drawing, chunky palate is bold and deep, with flavors of hickory, char and blackberry. With such forceful oak, this finishes woody, meaty and with pushy flavors of clove and mint.\n72604\tSpain\tFull, Dry Oloroso\t89\t13\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPedro Romero NV Full, Dry Oloroso Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tPedro Romero\tLT_90_Points\tNicely done and racy for an oloroso, with quince, baked peach and honey on the nose and then apricot and mocha flavors taking over in the mouth. Arguably a bit acidic, but that only helps to propel it toward an orange-tinged finish that's natural, sheer and clean.\n121816\tSpain\tReserva\t92\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConsejo de la Alta 2011 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tConsejo de la Alta\tGT_90_Points\tRooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are oaky and toasty, like burnt bread crust. This reserva feels weighty, but well balanced. Spicy currant and plum flavors are racy and improve on an elegant finish that doesn't overreach. Drink through 2026.\n106069\tSpain\tVina Hispana Roble\t87\t19\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Hispana 2011 Vina Hispana Roble Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFinca Hispana\tLT_90_Points\tInteresting aromas of mint, Christmas spice, licorice and blackberry feed into a dense, blocky palate with firm acidity. Ripe, loamy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with oak-driven graphite, mint and resiny flavors along with a note of residual cassis.

Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha.

On the palate, it is tightly wound and showing vital malic acid. Salty but fresh persimmon and quince flavors are lasting on the finish. For a 2014, this is in fine shape; drink now.\n74131\tSpain\tCuv??e 21 Brut\t90\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParxet NV Cuv??e 21 Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tParxet\tGT_90_Points\tThis is sweet, easy, powdery and entirely inviting on the nose.

This wine from a warm vintage is lush and lusty but less structured than other vintages. Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors end in a jammy fashion.

This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.\n11689\tSpain\tMas Elena Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon\t86\t22\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPar??s Balt?ÿ 2011 Mas Elena Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Pened??s)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tPar??s Balt?ÿ\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery and gaseous smelling, this Bordeaux blend also sports plum and berry scents.

The oak, however, is tame (just three months of barrel time for this youngster) not forced, thus the cherry and raspberry fruit has vibrancy and balance.\n54770\tSpain\tColeccion 125 Reserva\t92\t47\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Juli?­n Chivite 2006 Coleccion 125 Reserva Red (Navarra)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Juli?­n Chivite\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a dark, fully formed and impressive wine, one that's 70% Tempranillo and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

It's a little roasted on the nose, but it doesn't fall into the burnt or baked realm.

Baked berry, cassis and prune flavors fall off on a finish that tastes slightly cooked.\n44993\tSpain\tBrut\t80\t13\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Subirats NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tConde de Subirats\tLT_90_Points\tScattered, dusty, yeasty aromas of mustard and apple are less than welcoming. This feels choppy and strained, with vanilla and white-fruit flavors.\n91688\tSpain\tBecquer\t81\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Escudero 2009 Becquer White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBodegas Escudero\tLT_90_Points\tAlmond candy and lacquer aromas create a corny scent on the nose. This wine feels flabby and soggy, with buttery oak and little to no fruit flavor. Finishes woody, with vanilla and spice. A blend of 60% Viura and 40% Chardonnay.\n10167\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPingao 2013  Rioja\tTempranillo\tPingao\tLT_90_Points\tHarmonious but mild cherry and raspberry aromas are light and nice. This is substantive enough, with rubbery tannins and some chewiness to the palate. Generic flavors of raspberry and red plum finish mellow and easy.\n29736\tSpain\tS-Naia\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNaia 2014 S-Naia Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda)\tSauvignon Blanc\tNaia\tLT_90_Points\tPungent, feline aromas of sweat and cactus set up a sharp, citric palate that's loaded to the brim with acidity. Austere flavors of passion fruit and lime end with a note of mango along with a wave of citric burn.\n13964\tSpain\tCupatge d'Honor Brut\t87\t29\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPere Ventura 2011 Cupatge d'Honor Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tPere Ventura\tLT_90_Points\tLightly pickled, briny aromas are distant. In the mouth, this feels pinched and high in citric acid, but also refined. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit are tart, while lime and tangerine flavors are prominent on a briny, tart finish.\n119360\tSpain\tHado\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPujanza 2010 Hado  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tPujanza\tLT_90_Points\tEarly aromas of wet cement and rubber transition to leafy, herbal and mildly green. This feels tight, drawing and unforgiving. Flavors of leafy, roasted plum and berry are slightly stalky, while the finish is juicy in feel and herbal in flavor.\n99925\tSpain\t\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSembro 2007  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo Blend\tSembro\tLT_90_Points\tFairly attractive floral aromas are accented by ripe tomato, blueberry and tarry smoke notes. The palate has size and stickiness, while the flavors of berry, plum and graham cracker feature a sweet, pasty finish. Basic wine with 7% Merlot in the blend.\n106663\tSpain\tViernes\t83\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGodelia 2012 Viernes Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tGodelia\tLT_90_Points\tJumpy, young aromas of wet dog, plum, cherry and beet root set up a racy, high-acid palate. This tastes like medicinal raspberry and red plum, while the finish is light, scouring and fresh, with no oak character.\n126717\tSpain\tErgo\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMart??n C??dax 2005 Ergo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMart??n C??dax\tLT_90_Points\tDill and butter aromas announce aging in American oak, while the berry aromas are solid but common. This is a tightly wound wine with black cherry and olive flavors followed by length on the palate. It's not edgy, complex or beguiling, but it is full of fruit and has good balance. Imported by Mart??n C??dax USA.\n40050\tSpain\t\t87\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres 2007 Ros?? (Rioja)\tRos??\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres\tLT_90_Points\tCotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas. The palate is round and solidly formed, with creamsicle flavors and a bit of brown sugar or treacle. A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.\n97981\tSpain\tLas 2ces\t86\t11\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tChozas Carrascal 2015 Las 2ces Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\tBobal\tChozas Carrascal\tLT_90_Points\tThis Bobal's dark, earthy berry and leather aromas are closed but presentable. On the palate, herbal plum, tomato and lightly baked berry flavors finish with the scrub of rustic tannins.\n96778\tSpain\tEl Bon Homme\t88\t20\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rafael Cambra 2012 El Bon Homme Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Rafael Cambra\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, dusty aromas of sawdust and latex accent plum and blackberry scents. A juicy palate with fresh, kicking acidity renders this blend of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon crisp and honest. Flavors of lightly herbal plum and currant finish tasty and mild.\n64674\tSpain\t5 Finca Reserva\t83\t19\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Perelada 2005 5 Finca Reserva Red (Empord?ÿ)\tRed Blend\tCastillo de Perelada\tLT_90_Points\tAn oddball blend of many grapes that offers a spicy oak cover and sweet, earthy notes from front to back. But it's hard as nails, with blazing acidity, the result of which is a clacky, rough wine. On the plus side it has interesting flavors with tobacco and citrus notes.\n125803\tSpain\tAvaniel\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMonteabell??n 2009 Avaniel  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMonteabell??n\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with latex and mint scents that yield to cherry and plum aromas. Grabby and acidic in the mouth, with quick, racy plum and raspberry flavors. Juicy but not all that tasty or interesting. A generic style of RDD.\n52825\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Egu??a 2011 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Egu??a\tLT_90_Points\tPlum, cherry and cassis aromas are mildly woody. This feels firm, choppy and rugged. Flavors of cherry, plum and cassis reflect the nose, while this finishes ripe, with fresh acidity that comes with a controlled citrusy character.\n96175\tSpain\tReserva\t83\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Jauregui 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tConde de Jauregui\tLT_90_Points\tStalky, leathery aromas lack freshness and purity of fruit. This feels light to the point of dilute, while flavors of stalky raspberry finish salty and earthy, with a raw feel.\n111187\tSpain\tRiscal 1860\t84\t8\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRiscal 2000 Riscal 1860 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tRiscal\tLT_90_Points\tBulky and clumsy, with powerful early barnyard aromas that ultimately give way to more refined plum and cherry. While this wine has its virtues, it lacks elegance. And while we admit that it's a country wine that's probably meant to be a sizable, rustic quaff, it seems a bit too basic and borderline to garner a better review.\n21199\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBasagoiti 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tBasagoiti\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy reedy cherry and red-plum aromas open this high-acid sizzler from a cool vintage. Lean as a stick in terms of build, this tastes of raspberry, red plum and dry spices. A short but juicy and tight finish is ripping with acid. Drink through 2025.\n2153\tSpain\tSP??\t84\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Isidro Milagro 2015 SP?? Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Isidro Milagro\tLT_90_Points\tPrickly berry aromas include notes of both candied raspberry and cinnamon. This feels a bit clunky and sticky, with sugary berry flavors and a slightly cloying finish.\n64999\tSpain\tSangre de Toro Vi?ña Sol\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2011 Sangre de Toro Vi?ña Sol White (Catalunya)\tWhite Blend\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tApple, lime, lemon and natural vanilla are the aromas one gets from this blended Catalonian white. The palate is bright along the edges, a bit soft and jumbled in the middle, and in terms of flavor the wine offers generic apple and lime in front of a fresh but fleshy finish. Drink immediately.\n29842\tSpain\tBrut Nature\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBiutiful NV Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tBiutiful\tLT_90_Points\tWhite-fruit aromas are without frills. Like the nose, this wine feels fresh and clean. Flavors of white peach and slightly underripe honeydew are mild and don't force anything on a pleasant finish.\n94250\tSpain\tParaje de El Santo\t84\t69\tNorthern Spain\tTierra de Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPricum 2007 Paraje de El Santo Prieto Picudo (Tierra de Le??n)\tPrieto Picudo\tPricum\tLT_90_Points\tLemony and citrusy from the get-go, with floral notes to the nose. The palate is sheering and tart, with edgy tannins. As a whole, it's angular, with tomato and red-fruit flavors. A natural, jacked-up example of Prieto Picudo that's a bit underwhelming.\n40026\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2014 Ros?? (Rioja)\tRos??\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tStandard aromas of cantaloupe and lees feed into a bright, lively palate with bracing acidity and good overall balance. Nectarine and citrus flavors are basic but hang in there on a lasting finish.\n31116\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalacio del Burgo 2014 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPalacio del Burgo\tLT_90_Points\tOpen-grained oak aromas dominate a toasty nose with heat. This feels lean and tomatoey. Flavors of tart plum and pie cherry are almost sour and feel edgy due to severe wood tannins.\n32308\tSpain\tGran Sangre de Toro\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2003 Gran Sangre de Toro Red (Catalunya)\tRed Blend\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tRipe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.\n42527\tSpain\tMonte Real Gran Reserva\t90\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2001 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution. Flavors of dried raspberry, plum, earth and brown sugar are solid and classic. Drink now through 2013.\n86242\tSpain\tPremium Sweet Sherry 1827\t91\t20\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne NV Premium Sweet Sherry 1827 Pedro Xim??nez (Jerez)\tPedro Xim??nez\tOsborne\tGT_90_Points\tSo thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.\n64998\tSpain\tSangre de Toro\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2011 Sangre de Toro Tempranillo (Catalunya)\tTempranillo\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tThis Tempranillo is forward in style, with leather, cherry, plum and smoky aromas. It feels racy and healthy, with buttery oak, vanilla, herb and mild raspberry and red plum flavors. This is good as a whole, with no one characteristic sticking out.\n90612\tSpain\tBrut\t83\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTarantas 2011 Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tTarantas\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens with vanilla and sweet, powdery aromas. In the mouth, it's bubbly and foamy, with a mix of pickled citrus and dry apple flavors. The finish is crisp and dry like a soda cracker.\n6705\tSpain\tEl Sequ??\t91\t45\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2012 El Sequ?? Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tThis magenta-hued Monastrell opens with concentrated aromas of jammy wild berries, herbs and rubber. The palate feels fleshy and chunky, while herbal, earthy blackberry and plum flavors precede a full-force finish of herbal, briny and salty accents. Drink through 2022.\n33144\tSpain\tMade With Organic Grapes\t85\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaso a Paso 2013 Made With Organic Grapes White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tWhite Blend\tPaso a Paso\tLT_90_Points\tThere is no indication on the bottle what this blend might be. Regardless of composition, it's a generic, solid wine with melon and vanilla cookie aromas backed by a round, citrusy mouthfeel. Flavors of briny citrus and white grapefruit finish decently.\n110019\tSpain\tMC\t92\t33\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres 2011 MC  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres\tGT_90_Points\tThis is arguably the best MC C?­ceres has bottled. Dense, smoky aromas of bacon, toast and blackberry are showing well. A concentrated yet balanced palate is home to flavors of ripe black fruits accented by proper doses of spice and leather. A toasty finish is black as night, with coffee and hard spice notes. Drink through 2020.\n8766\tSpain\t\t89\t15\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBula 2012 Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tBula\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, charred aromas are rugged and center around black fruits. This is a blend of Mazuelo (Carignan), Garnacha and Syrah, and it's decidedly ripe. Loamy flavors of blackberry and plum are earthy, while the finish is toasty and ends with a bitter espresso note.\n129588\tSpain\tAmandi\t90\t17\tGalicia\tRibeira Sacra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDon Bernardino 2012 Amandi Menc??a (Ribeira Sacra)\tMenc??a\tDon Bernardino\tGT_90_Points\tEarthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Menc??a is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness.\n102927\tSpain\t\t86\t23\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo de Galegos 2014 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tPazo de Galegos\tLT_90_Points\tAn initial blast of hot summer field and nepeta muddles the clarity of the nose. This is a bit flat and lacking in verve. Flavors of apricot and nectarine turn pithy on the finish.\n32832\tSpain\tEl Circulo Crianza\t87\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Rey 2012 El Circulo Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPagos del Rey\tLT_90_Points\tDusty aromas of plum and berry fruits come with a touch of latex. This feels crisp, snappy and on edge. Lean, bright flavors of red currant and plum finish fresh, light and the slightest bit briny.\n28567\tSpain\tGran Reserva Brut Nature\t80\t27\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOriol Rossell NV Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tOriol Rossell\tLT_90_Points\tThere's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.\n61615\tSpain\tRoble\t90\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEncanto 2011 Roble Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tEncanto\tGT_90_Points\tThis fresh, pure value red cranks out raspberry and boysenberry aromas in front of a crisp, tight palate. Ripe, quick-hitting flavors of red-berry fruits and toasty smoke finish zesty, with a lasting note of pie cherry.\n6120\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada\t92\t41\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAnier 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAnier\tGT_90_Points\tCedar and coconut aromas rest comfortably atop ripe black fruit scents. In the mouth this is juicy pure and well structured. Big chocolaty flavors of mixed black fruits show strong notes of charred wood and grilled meat on a toasty chocolaty finish. Drink through 2022.\n19281\tSpain\tJME\t87\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2007 JME  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSpicy and jumpy on the nose, with pine and juniper notes coming alongside more normal berry and cherry scents. The palate has a severe snappy, citrusy, narrow feel and flavors of cherry, red plum and cherry tomato. Lightly herbal and oaky on the finish, with good length.\n67525\tSpain\t\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Montepedroso 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tFinca Montepedroso\tLT_90_Points\tFriendly aromas of apple and stone fruits are inviting and clean. This is cutting on the palate, but not overly so, with a good feel and cleansing acids. Apple and lime flavors finish bright and uncomplicated.\n1846\tSpain\tFermentado en Barrica\t83\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tEresma\tLT_90_Points\tGold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.\n80082\tSpain\tT?­bula\t92\t55\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas y Vi?ñedos T?­bula 2009 T?­bula  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas y Vi?ñedos T?­bula\tGT_90_Points\tThis is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de T?­bula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone. Drink from 2014ƒ??2022.\n56941\tSpain\t\t83\t28\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos de Torona 2013 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAltos de Torona\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy, oxidized aromas suggest Sherry and late-harvest wines. A peachy, fully mature palate offers apricot and papaya flavors in front of a salty, dry finish with fino Sherry notes.\n68621\tSpain\tHoya de Cadenas Reserva\t85\t10\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVicente Gandia 2011 Hoya de Cadenas Reserva Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena)\tTempranillo\tVicente Gandia\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, leathery aromas of plum and berry are a touch rustic. This feels rubbery and raw, but fresh. Dry, earthy plum flavors are limited, while the finish is short, with a tight, chalky feel.\n24160\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlidis 2014 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAlidis\tLT_90_Points\tChunky obtuse aromas of berry fruits are a bit damp and volatile. This is heavy and severely tannic, while blackened berry and prune flavors come across a bit stewed. A drawing tannic finish brings this to a close.\n56032\tSpain\t\t82\t9\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sindoa 2012 Viura-Chardonnay (Navarra)\tViura-Chardonnay\tVega Sindoa\tLT_90_Points\tWith a tan tint and aromas of banana, undefined stone fruits and slight chemical, this is not all that inviting. The palate is on the flat side, while pithy flavors of melon and citrus finish with a bitter note of almond skins.\n9703\tSpain\tCastillo de Jumilla\t86\t10\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Bleda 2008 Castillo de Jumilla Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Bleda\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.\n35122\tSpain\tArdal Gran Reserva Selecci??n Especial\t91\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBalbas 2009 Ardal Gran Reserva Selecci??n Especial  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tBalbas\tGT_90_Points\tBaked raisiny aromas of spice cake are almost overdone. Like many 2009 RDDs, this is huge, tannic and massive as a whole. A woody flavor profile includes earthy jammy berry fruit, while this is heavy with campfire notes on the finish. This is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink through 2023.\n29954\tSpain\tGran Reserva Barrica Brut Nature\t93\t37\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata 2008 Gran Reserva Barrica Brut Nature Macabeo (Cava)\tMacabeo\tAgust?? Torell?? Mata\tGT_90_Points\tThis is superb Cava, no ifs, ands or buts. Soft, yeasty, complex aromas of bready apple and spice feed into a round, yeasty palate. Bready flavors of pear, papaya and mango end with stony minerality and a closing note of lime.\n60273\tSpain\tPrima\t90\t18\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaurodos 2005 Prima  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMaurodos\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.\n4760\tSpain\tConde de Valdemar Reserva\t90\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Valdemar\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.\n120807\tSpain\tPrima\t90\t24\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaurodos 2014 Prima  (Toro)\tTempranillo Blend\tMaurodos\tGT_90_Points\tBlack-fruit scents combined with cheesy oak aromas are common for Toro. This wine has a wide, pulpy, grabby palate and flavors of black plum, herbal blackberry and savory meat. There's plenty of weight and substance, but it's also a bit stretched and bumpy along the way.\n78851\tSpain\tDel Duque Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum Amontillado\t93\t50\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonz?­lez Byass NV Del Duque Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tGonz?­lez Byass\tGT_90_Points\tToffee and almond aromas are a touch aggressive and hot. Matching the nose, this is intense but still well balanced by core acidity. A giant heaping of rancio blends with flavors of almond skins, apricot and salt in front of a never-ending finish.\n68257\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t91\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontecillo 2009 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tMontecillo\tGT_90_Points\tBaked berry and cherry aromas are ripe and come with accents of mocha, leather and caramel. This feels full but not heavy, with balance and cushion to the palate. Spiced black-fruit flavors show a tea-like note, while this is dry, spicy and a touch chocolaty on the finish.

Flavors of tropical fruit and peach are slightly bitter and carry a saline note, while the finish ends taut and dry.

Toasted oak, mint, cola, maple, marzipan work the potent nose, while the saturated palate thumps along with massive black-fruit flavors and coffee, fudge and light herb accents. This is one of the most powerful wines from Spain or anywhere. Drink or hold.\n15929\tSpain\tCosecha Limitada\t91\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tHesvera 2009 Cosecha Limitada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tHesvera\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, baked, raisiny aromas of blackberry, coconut, resiny oak, tomato sauce and herbs set up a racy, high-intensity palate with flavors of berry, fig and blackened spices. The finish is rooty in flavor, with notes of licorice and chocolate offset by sharp residual acidity.\n40810\tSpain\tLa Dama\t90\t43\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAldonia 2007 La Dama  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tAldonia\tGT_90_Points\tSoft, baked aromas of rooty, dark-berry fruits are easier going than the wine's high-toned, acid-driven palate. Flavors of vanilla, coconut, tobacco, prune and spiced berry fruits finish with length and structure along with tobacco and nutmeg accents. Drink through 2020.\n86633\tSpain\tDon PX Vino Natural\t89\t24\tAndalucia\tMontilla-Moriles\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL 2014 Don PX Vino Natural Pedro Xim??nez (Montilla-Moriles)\tPedro Xim??nez\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL\tLT_90_Points\tWhile this breathes alcohol, there's also requisite caramel, fig and chocolate aromas on the nose of this heavy Pedro Xim??nez. Flavors of raw honey and caramel dominate a syrupy finish. Consider this for an ice cream topping rather than as a drink.\n80365\tSpain\tVilata Old Vines\t84\t10\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLo Nuevo 2011 Vilata Old Vines Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tLo Nuevo\tLT_90_Points\tGritty aromas of grilled meat, rubber and baked plum lead to a candied tasting, syrupy feeling palate that's sweet in flavor and mildly oaky. This results in a rich finish that's sticky, a bit hot and ripe.\n17587\tSpain\tKila\t87\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVins El Cep 2014 Kila Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tVins El Cep\tLT_90_Points\tApple, vanilla and a hint of sulfur is what you'll find on the nose of this consistently solid value-priced Cava.

Pomal shows classic autumn leaf and wood aromas that highlight subdued cherry and molasses scents. The palate is properly acidic, so it places the lighter-weight cherry and tobacco notes in a proper frame. Turns oakier and more smoky the longer it sits.\n100813\tSpain\t\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2009 Tempranillo-Garnacha (Navarra)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tOchoa\tLT_90_Points\tDark, dense and nice on the nose, with aromas of dried cheese, blackberry and plum. Fresh, juicy and healthy in the mouth, with blackberry and plum flavors that run long and clean. Freshness and juicy clarity are this wine's chief attributes.\n2548\tSpain\t\t89\t15\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tApple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of Albari?ño's common pithy bitterness.\n74200\tSpain\tInspiraci??n Valdemar Las Seis Alhajas\t89\t\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2010 Inspiraci??n Valdemar Las Seis Alhajas  (Rioja)\tGraciano\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tPlum, blackberry and dusty earth aromas set up a racy, linear palate with sharp acidity and just enough padding. Raisin, wild berry and black pepper are the key flavors, while the finish is zesty, acidic and blackened in flavor. Drink through 2020.\n116647\tSpain\t\t87\t15\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLagar de Bouza 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tLagar de Bouza\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of nettle, citrus fruits and stream water set up a minerally palate with some plumpness. Moderately intense stone fruit and citrus flavors finish melony.\n88195\tSpain\t\t85\t19\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo de Arribi 2010 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tPazo de Arribi\tLT_90_Points\tRound and melony, but also a bit heavy and mealy smelling, indicating that it's starting to turn. Feels chunky, with lychee, sweet citrus and pithy flavors. Adequate acidity rises up on the finish, but overall this is a chunky, ripe type of Godello that seems to be fading prematurely.\n48939\tSpain\tDimidium Nobleza\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasado Morales 2010 Dimidium Nobleza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCasado Morales\tLT_90_Points\tThis Tempranillo is electric purple in color, with aromas of rubber, horse hide and grapy berry. It's round and jammy feeling, with tannic grip and jammy flavors of baked, earthy berry fruits, followed by a savory, meaty, roasted tasting finish.\n2154\tSpain\tEstate Wine Organic\t84\t18\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos de Risca 2013 Estate Wine Organic Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tCampos de Risca\tLT_90_Points\tDusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained. This feels raw and choppy, while reedy herbal red-fruit flavors finish with a note of raisin. This Monastrell (with 10% Syrah) is okay but all over the map.\n36108\tSpain\tEl P?­jaro Rojo\t89\t16\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2015 El P?­jaro Rojo Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tLosada\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery, leathery berry aromas are edged with woody accents. There's intensity and depth to the palate, which doles out rustic plum and berry flavors. A moderately powerful but ripe finish concludes this likable Menc??a from a good year.\n116263\tSpain\tAldeya\t85\t11\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago Ayl??s 2012 Aldeya Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tPago Ayl??s\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery, horsey lead aromas include hints of licorice, baked plum and green herbs. This Garnacha has a saucy, tomatoey feel and leafy red-berry flavors that finish with a hint of sweet caramel and herbal overtones.\n49156\tSpain\tTierra de Estella\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFortius 1998 Tierra de Estella Tempranillo (Navarra)\tTempranillo\tFortius\tLT_90_Points\tFrom the Valcarlos winery, this Tempranillo has some berry aromas, earth and a bit of grain on the nose. The flavor profile deals plum, cassis and some green olive, while the finish is lean and toasty. The texture is nice, and, while it's not terribly packed with bold flavors or extract, it gets the job done and delivers a solid expression of the grape type and region.\n46921\tSpain\tFermentado en Barrica\t89\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValserrano 2015 Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tValserrano\tLT_90_Points\tToasty melon and peach aromas are oaky but elegant, sort of like nice Burgundy. A round balanced palate definitely suggests quality Chardonnay, but this is 95% Viura and the rest Malvasia. Oak and spice flavors render white-fruit notes secondary, and the finish is more of the same. Drink through 2020.\n45526\tSpain\tFino\t85\t12\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne NV Fino Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tOsborne\tLT_90_Points\tThis blends nutty notes with aromas of chemical and saline. The palate is tight, sharp and citric, while flavors of briny apricot come with bitter as well as nutty notes. A dry, salty finish feels angular and sharp.\n79277\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArroyo 2014 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tArroyo\tLT_90_Points\tA dark purple color and reduced, funky stewed fruit and leather aromas open this tannic, hard-bodied Tempranillo. Its mix of tea and stewed berry flavors finishes rough, with a meaty note.\n10826\tSpain\tLa Miranda Secastilla\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ñas del Vero 2015 La Miranda Secastilla Garnacha Blanca (Somontano)\tGarnacha Blanca\tVi?ñas del Vero\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy pear and apple aromas lead to a lean, acidic palate. This Garnacha Blanca from the highest vineyards in Somontano tastes of briny citrus and tart apple. A slightly green finish with pickled notes closes it out.\n128228\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Clavijo 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tCastillo Clavijo\tLT_90_Points\tFamiliar Rioja aromas of cigar box, baking spices and dried cherry introduce a dense, sinewy palate. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate include peppery spice notes, which are balanced on the way out.\n30965\tSpain\tGran Coronas Reserva\t87\t20\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2003 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Pened??s)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tStarts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet. But the feel is good and chewy, while the oak is moderate as it supports raspberry and dry cherry flavors. Features 15% Tempranillo; drink now.\n20151\tSpain\tCordon Negro Sweet Cuv??e\t83\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Sweet Cuv??e Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tVague tropical fruit aromas give way to a petrol note. High in acid but even higher in sugar, this offers flavors of orange and lime that finish fast.\n71588\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Cantabria 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tSierra Cantabria\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat. The palate, on the other hand, is more lean, driving and citric than in riper years; it's crisp and fresh, with red plum, pie cherry and toasty oak flavors. Clean, lean and ready to drink.\n23892\tSpain\t3C\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos 2015 3C Cari?ñena (Cari?ñena)\tCarine?ña\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos\tLT_90_Points\tWiry cherry and berry aromas are a bit medicinal and soapy. This is named after the grape, region and town, all called Cari?ñena. It's a pinched wine with raw rubbery tannins and salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. A crisp tough finish is the close.\n51549\tSpain\tGrans Muralles\t90\t105\tCatalonia\tConca de Barber?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2006 Grans Muralles Red (Conca de Barber?ÿ)\tRed Blend\tTorres\tGT_90_Points\tRoasted and leathery upon first impression, with a juicy, mildly astringent palate that's full up with tannins. Tastes baked and leathery, with herbal accents running alongside roasted berry flavors. Tannic grip rises up on the finish, which is clampy and hard but offers sturdy support to what is ultimately a pedigreed Catalonian blend.\n69055\tSpain\t\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2015 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tBright fruity plum and raspberry aromas are typical of this wine. The palate is a bit rough and abrasive, while flavors of salty plum and chocolate are punchy prior to a solid but basic finish.\n90867\tSpain\tSelecci??n\t89\t16\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIcono 2013 Selecci??n Red (Valencia)\tRed Blend\tIcono\tLT_90_Points\tDark berry aromas, chocolate and grit define the nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo. The palate feels ripe and fresh, but the tannins are hard and grabby. Black plum flavors are bold and offer notes of spice, herbs and earthiness. This is composed on the finish despite a reprise of hard smacking tannins.\n4966\tSpain\tEls Ameliers\t90\t35\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLafou 2011 Els Ameliers Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)\tGarnacha Blanca\tLafou\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a really good showing for the Garnacha Blanca grape. The bouquet is fresh and not the least bit blowsy, with an emphasis on apple and pear aromas. The wine is plump, fruity and showing modest acidity, while flavors of apple and baking spices precede a finish that's easygoing. Drink now.\n35000\tSpain\tReserva\t92\t59\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLleiroso 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLleiroso\tGT_90_Points\tToasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.\n125225\tSpain\tEl Circo Acr??bata\t85\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos 2014 El Circo Acr??bata Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos\tLT_90_Points\tJumpy, candied-cherry and berry aromas are straight from Kool-Aid city. Fresh on the palate, with pure but simple cherry, plum and raspberry flavors, this is meant for simple sipping. Serve lightly chilled for best results.\n94080\tSpain\tVega Mont?­n\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Adri?­ 2009 Vega Mont?­n Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tBodegas Adri?­\tLT_90_Points\tLight and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.\n7716\tSpain\tRioja Bord??n Crianza\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas 2003 Rioja Bord??n Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas\tLT_90_Points\tPretty nice for a lean, more traditional Rioja crianza. The palate is clean and tangy, with strawberry, raspberry and citrusy flavors. Freshness is this wine's middle name. It's old-school, so don't look for a lot of color, body or sweetness.\n104590\tSpain\tLoidana\t85\t30\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarco Abella 2009 Loidana Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMarco Abella\tLT_90_Points\tFrom the starting gun, this is a raisiny, candied wine with complexity issues. The palate is tannic and not the least bit varied; basically it just sits there. Flavors of raisin and red licorice finish sweet, medicinal and with a note of green peppercorn. This is flavorful but blocky and strange.\n40027\tSpain\tClos de Torribas\t87\t12\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPinord 2014 Clos de Torribas Ros?? (Pened??s)\tRos??\tPinord\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of peach, red apple skins and cantaloupe come with powdery, soapy notes. This feels fresh, with vivid flavors of stone fruits and peach pit. A steady, clean finish renders this proper for immediate consumption.\n37278\tSpain\tReserva\t91\t20\tNorthern Spain\tCigales\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuseum 2011 Reserva Tempranillo (Cigales)\tTempranillo\tMuseum\tGT_90_Points\tThis Tempranillo from little-known Cigales opens with potent crushed brick, spice, toasty oak and berry aromas. The palate has a juicy, fresh outlook and no excess weight or overextraction. Its plum, berry, spice and vanilla flavors finish with a note of mature, sweet tobacco. Drink through 2020.\n96969\tSpain\tVII Tempranillo\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Faustino 2016 VII Tempranillo Ros?? (Rioja)\tRos??\tBodegas Faustino\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, fruity aromas center around red apple and cherry. This pink-colored ros?? is fairly full in body, with ample acidity. Slightly salty but fruity plum flavors end steady and level.\n42244\tSpain\tSeis\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLuberri 2011 Seis  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tLuberri\tLT_90_Points\tSlightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.\n11683\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPata Negra 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tPata Negra\tLT_90_Points\tSavory, slightly saucy aromas of plum, berry, tomato and leather come with a hint of oak. This is a bit choppy and tannic, with savory, roasted flavors of tomato, plum, currant and spice. A touch of saltiness and raw-oak flavor rise up on the finish.\n27301\tSpain\tJME\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2011 JME  (Rioja)\tGraciano\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.\n98062\tSpain\tColecci??n Vivanco Parcelas\t87\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinast??a Vivanco 2009 Colecci??n Vivanco Parcelas  (Rioja)\tMaturana\tDinast??a Vivanco\tLT_90_Points\tJudged against more familiar varietal wines, this Maturana comes across as unusual, but not bad. Herbal aromas of juniper and briny berry are typical for the grape. Flavors of stewed blueberry, juniper and herbs are naturally green-leaning and a bit odd. This is something to explore.\n111067\tSpain\t\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRio Madre 2010  Rioja\tGraciano\tRio Madre\tLT_90_Points\tDark in color, with plum, berry and medicinal aromas. Round, full and in good shape, with dark plum, blackberry and a lot of oak for a $10 wine. Finishes creamy and big, with a spicy aftertaste. Plump and solid for value-priced Graciano.\n50335\tSpain\tUnico\t91\t450\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sicilia 2003 Unico  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tVega Sicilia\tGT_90_Points\tHailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum. Dense but soft, it has rubbery, savory flavors of barbecue sauce, herbal plum, tomato and carob. An earthy, loamy, chunky finish offers tobacco and baking spice accents. Drink through 2020.\n94735\tSpain\t\t91\t30\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLusco 2014 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tLusco\tGT_90_Points\tLight, airy and leesy on the nose, this is more complex than most everyday Albari?ños. Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish.\n32982\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValdelacierva 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tValdelacierva\tGT_90_Points\tCherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla.

This feels round and juicy, with flavors of green herbs, lettuce, lime and orange. Tangerine notes carry the finish, which is linear and racy in feel before turning slightly pithy in flavor.\n93571\tSpain\tEmbruix\t90\t27\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2013 Embruix Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tPure, deep berry aromas are accented by quality oak and a hint of earthy prune. Chewy, dense and concentrated on the palate, this tastes ripe, chocolaty and earthy, with blackberry and pepper flavors that stay the course and finish peppery and dark, with a mild note of rubber. Drink through 2019.\n123902\tSpain\tParada de Atauta\t91\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio de Atauta 2012 Parada de Atauta  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tDominio de Atauta\tGT_90_Points\tSophisticated aromas of blackberry, dried cherry, shoe polish and crushed leaves set up a grabby palate with ripe, bullish tannins. This wine offers black-fruit flavors along with spice, chocolate and herbal notes. On the finish, ripe berry and chocolaty oak flavors are generous. Drink through 2019.\n117931\tSpain\tGold Label\t92\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Gitana 2014 Gold Label  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tLa Gitana\tGT_90_Points\tVanilla, oak spice, tea, berry, olive and herb aromas signal a classic Rioja. Its crisp palate and choppy tannins form the canvas for spicy berry and cassis flavors. More spice powers the finish, which has the fruit to absorb and support the high level of oak. Drink through 2025.\n70916\tSpain\tEidos de Padri?ñ?­n\t89\t24\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAdega dos Eidos 2009 Eidos de Padri?ñ?­n Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAdega dos Eidos\tLT_90_Points\tCreamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees. Finishes long and classy, with elegance. Drink immediately before it loses its vitality.\n116515\tSpain\tSobre Lias\t87\t27\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGuiti?­n 2006 Sobre Lias Godello (Valdeorras)\tGodello\tGuiti?­n\tLT_90_Points\tThere's a fine line between a fresh Godello and one that's starting to turn. This one may soon fall into the latter category, but before it gets there look for peppery white-fruit aromas and flavors. Tastes of honeyed melon are  topped with cracked black pepper.

This feels chunky almost to the point of being lazy, while earthy, baked black-fruit flavors are slightly salty. This Bobal holds firm on the finish, which is meaty in texture but herbal and medicinal in flavor.\tTemperamento\tLT_90_Points\t16\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\tBobal\tSierra Norte 2013 Temperamento Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\n109149\tUS\tGood Pinot Noir for the price.

Supple and round on the palate, it's framed delicately with soft tannins and a fringe of smoke and dried herbs.\tCuv??e Noir\tLT_90_Points\t22\tPfalz\t\t\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\tRed Blend\tPfl?¬ger 2012 Cuv??e Noir Red (Pfalz)\n62394\tItaly\tForward notes of black fruit and cherry are followed by touches of white almond and rum cake.

The apple fruit is tied into a streak of bright, lemony freshness concluding in a just off-dry, invigorating finish.\tTrois Chateaux\tLT_90_Points\t26\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tRiesling\tKuentz-Bas 2014 Trois Chateaux Riesling (Alsace)\n100448\tUS\tOuch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.\tJardine\tLT_90_Points\t26\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\tPetite Sirah\tVina Robles 2005 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)\n101012\tUS\tThis 100% varietal wine was aged 18 months in American oak and is vaguely pharmaceutical in aromas.

Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.\t\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tBlue Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n99310\tItaly\tThis 60-30-10 Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Aglianico blend from southern Italy delivers beautiful purity and intensity. Aromas here include blackberry, tobacco, leather, rum cake and polished black stone. It tastes firm and full on the palate and could use a few more years of cellar aging.\t\tGT_90_Points\t\tSouthern Italy\tCampania\t\t\tRed Blend\tMontevetrano 2008 Red (Campania)\n95790\tFrance\tFinely structured and aromatic, this is initially dense before opening up with ripe yellow fruit, becoming balanced by orange- and tangerine-like acidity.

Very full in body, it is still appetizingly dry, balanced for serving at a special meal, and very rewarding to drink now through 2022.\tGrand Wren\tGT_90_Points\t100\tCalifornia\tAmador County\tSierra Foothills\tJim Gordon\tZinfandel\tRenwood 2012 Grand Wren Zinfandel (Amador County)\n105694\tGermany\tPristine orange blossom and tangerine hints turn riper and richer on the palate in this delicately honeyed Riesling. It's lively and deft in mouthfeel, with sweet yellow cherry and peach flavors that dart on the midpalate. A sun-filled yet gorgeously balanced wine, it's calibrated by scintillating acidity and a mineral sheen on the finish.\tBernkasteler Lay Auslese\tGT_90_Points\t38\tMosel\t\t\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\tRiesling\tDr. H.

The palate is cleaner with a more crisp, acidic edge that stays through the close.\tFynbos\tLT_90_Points\t14\tStellenbosch\t\t\tLauren Buzzeo\tChenin Blanc\tXavier Flouret 2010 Fynbos Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)\n49357\tUS\tThis is a fun and lively blend of 38% Grenache, 24% Cinsault, 21% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah, with aromas of fresh wild berries and white pepper. The flavors are berry punch-like, with intriguing clove, licorice and anise.\tCuv??e de Robles\tLT_90_Points\t20\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tRobert Hall 2013 Cuv??e de Robles Red (Paso Robles)\n114122\tChile\tThis is a new wine from one of Chile's most consistent producers, and it's quite the saturated bruiser. The color is deep purple, while the nose is raw and heavy, with deep fruit and plenty of bacon-like character. The mouth is like blackberry pie, while the feel is full and tannic, although not at all offensive or tough. The finish is dark, brooding and just a little bitter. An interesting new entry to Chile's roster, and one that's very well oaked.\tCuv??e Alexandre\tLT_90_Points\t20\tRapel Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\tSyrah\tLapostolle 2001 Cuv??e Alexandre Syrah (Rapel Valley)\n46646\tUS\tOak-driven aromas are strong on the nose, with buttered popcorn dominating. Full and rich, notes of cedar and toast pervade over a hint of green apple. A bit lazy on the palate, this oaked style is for those who enjoy rich and creamy Chardonnay.\tBarrel Fermented\tLT_90_Points\t23\tVirginia\tVirginia\t\tAlexander Peartree\tChardonnay\tVeramar 2013 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Virginia)\n33332\tArgentina\tLike many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.\tLibertad Vineyards\tLT_90_Points\t25\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\tSyrah\tBenegas 2008 Libertad Vineyards Syrah (Mendoza)\n113123\tSlovenia\tThis Slovenian sparkling wine is made from 100% Ribolla Gialla in the Charmat method.

Sullivan\tSauvignon Blanc\tBarnard Griffin 2015 Fume Blanc Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))\n113627\tUS\tVanilla and butter touches give this medium-bodied, rather oaky wine extra richness. Its soft, creamy texture and muted fruit flavors are a bit unusual for the type, but it's still quite enjoyable to sip.\tBulletproof Picasso\tLT_90_Points\t10\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\tJim Gordon\tSauvignon Blanc\tSave Me San Francisco 2016 Bulletproof Picasso Sauvignon Blanc (California)\n47273\tChile\tStarts out hard and rustic, but soon it unfolds with cola, black fruit and earthy leather aromas.

A blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Cabernet Sauvignon, the palate offers dried black cherry, anise, tobacco and roasted coffee bean alongside ample tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up, so don't hold on to this too long.\tCapro\tLT_90_Points\t53\tTuscany\tColli della Toscana Centrale\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\tRed Blend\tFattoria Bagnolo 2010 Capro Red (Colli della Toscana Centrale)\n128472\tUS\tPretty good price for a Napa Cabernet as elegant as this. It's a polished wine for drinking now. Shows smooth, refined tannins, with interesting flavors of blackberries, red plums, red currants, tobacco and dusty spices. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.\t\tLT_90_Points\t25\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBuehler 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\n31681\tSpain\tWilting apricot and nectarine aromas are pithy and lead to a dying palate. Flavors of citrus rind and papaya show some acidic kick, while the finish is tropical in flavor and fading.
